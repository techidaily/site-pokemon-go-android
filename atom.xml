What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?<p>Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.</p><p>The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.</p><p>Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Lineup of Creature</th><th>Pokemon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First</td><td>Persian</td></tr><tr><td>Second</td><td>Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp</td></tr><tr><td>Third</td><td>Mewtwo</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.</p><p>When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.</p><p>Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn’t just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.</p><p>Once you defeat Team Go Rocket’s second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn’t be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.</p><p>Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014853/22899" target="_top" id="2014853">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014853" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014853/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3.

With that, you can use the same Pokemon twice, thereby keeping your choice for Legendary Shadow Pokemon safe till you need it to beat Giovani.</p><p>Mind you, the big bad boss, Giovani has two Protect Shields at his disposal so you have to be careful while fighting against the monster. We implore you to start your game with a Pokemon that has a Charged move so you can charge as fast as possible.</p><p>Getting a strong Pokemon won’t come with ease, however, with the use of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone- Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can achieve this.

Basically, Dratini nests and spawn points are the same for a period of two weeks. The nests then migrate leaving the spawn points to spawn different types of Pokémon.</p><p>If the Dratini nest migrates, it can still come back in the future. You should always keep an eye at the spawn point where you first encountered your first Dratini Nest; it may come back once more and you can continue farming Dratini.</p><p>Dratini nests will migrate on alternate Thursdays at midnight. The nest migrations are random, so make sure that you visit and hit them many times over the two weeks in order to get the most Dratini that you can.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-increase-the-possibility-of-earning-Pokemon-Go-Dratini"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-increase-the-possibility-of-earning-Pokemon-Go-Dratini" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?"></a>Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Dratini can be found in certain places around the world.

When you’re playing with other users, you can earn Stardust based on the number of your previous wins, your game level, and the PVP outcome.</p><p>For instance, if you’re a Rank 2, you can earn around 2,000 Stardust points by winning a battle, and if you’re Rank 24, the number increases to about 200,000. You can also use a Star Piece to multiply your winnings by 1.5.</p><p>Another method is to play with your friends, and the Stardust points can vary from 300 to 1000, depending on your opponent’s rank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-3.jpg"                      alt="pvp in pokemon go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135393/19272" target="_top" id="2135393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135393/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### By Opening Gifts<p>Opening gifts is one of the main components of the Pokemon Go experience. You’ll get daily gifts you can open for free, earn valuable items, and support your gameplay. Each gift can carry a certain amount of Stardust particles, so you don’t have to do anything to accumulate these items.</p><p>The maximum Stardust you can get in one gift is 300, which may not seem like a lot. However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-4.jpg"                      alt="opening gifts in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Hatching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Hatching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Hatching Pokemon"></a>By Hatching Pokemon</h3><p>Hatching a Pokemon is also one of the essential parts of your Pokemon experience. Every time you hatch an egg, you’ll get Stardust points you can spend on numerous instances. The Stardust amount will depend on the egg itself; the higher the rank, the better the prices.</p><p>You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:</p><ul><li>400–800 Stardust for hatching a 2km egg;</li><li>600–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 5km egg;</li><li>800–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 7km egg;</li><li>1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;</li><li>3200–6400 Stardust for hatching a 12km egg.</li></ul><p>You can also use the Star Piece item to multiply the Stardust amount by 1.5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg"                      alt="eggs in pokemon go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### By Catching Pokemon<p>Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.</p><p>Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.</p><p>If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-6.jpg"                      alt="catch a pokemon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982461">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982461">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982461.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982461%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982461/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### By Claiming Raid Rewards<p>When the Boss enters your Gym, you may think it’s a stressful scenario.

Fixed<p>The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working"><a href="#Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working"></a>Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working</h2><p>Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><h3 id="Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue"><a href="#Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue"></a>Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue</h3><p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Install the Official Version:</strong> It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.</li></ul><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123466/16836" target="_top" id="2123466">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123466" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123466/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location<p>If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use.

So how does this trading work? In Pokemon Go, you can trade pokemon possessed by you with those possessed by your friends if both you and your friend, decide to mutually trade the pokemon with each other! For trading in Pokemon go, there are certain criteria you need to satisfy to qualify for trading in Pokemon go! Given below are the requirements to qualify for trading in Pokemon go</p><ul><li>Be at least level 10</li><li>Be friends with the person you’re trading on Pokemon go</li><li>Be in a radius of 100 m while you’re trading</li></ul><p>However, Pokemon go also has levels of friendship and you can trade pokemon of different levels with friends with whom you have different friendship levels. Higher is the friendship level, higher is the level of Pokemon which you can trade. every trade requires you and your partner to spend stardust points. So There are basically 4 levels of friendship in Pokemon go</p><ul><li>Friend</li><li>Good friend</li><li>Ultra friend</li><li>Best friend</li></ul><p>The levels of your friendship with a player on Pokemon go increase with the increase in the number of days you stay friends with them. Within a month of friendship, you can become best friends with a player on Pokemon go! You also need stardust points on Pokemon go. So what is stardust trade cost? Before you trade any pokemon you must spend stardust coins. Not having enough stardust trade coins will not allow the trade of pokemon to happen. Hence, you must have enough stardust trade costs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137221/26400" target="_top" id="2137221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137221/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: How much stardust do you need in pokemon trading costs?<p>Trading in Pokemon go is quite complex. This is because the needed Stardust points will be different in every case and will depend on several factors. Factors such as whether you already half got that Pokemon in your pokedesk or not, the friendship level of you and your friend who are interested in trading, or whether the Pokemon is rare or common. Given below are the Stardust trade costs for each Pokemon.</p><p><strong>Standard trades</strong></p><ul><li>Good friend:100</li><li>Great friends:80</li><li>Ultra Friends: 8</li><li>Best friend: 4</li></ul><p><strong>Shiny or legendary (caught by you)</strong></p><ul><li>Good Friend: 20,000</li><li>Great Friend: 16,000</li><li>Ultra Friend: 1,600</li><li>Best Friend: 800</li></ul><p><strong>Shiny or Legendary (not caught by you)</strong></p><ul><li>Good Friend: 1,000,000</li><li>Great Friend: 800,000</li><li>Ultra Friend: 80,000</li><li>Best Friend: 40,000</li></ul><p>However, this Stardust trade cost may vary according to the friendship levels! Before trading, you must think of the friendship level between you and your friend and also if the Pokemon which has been traded can be evolved through trading. Evolving Pokemon through trading is another beneficial tactic that could benefit you as a player of Pokemon go.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Ways-to-increase-stardust-in-pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-3-Ways-to-increase-stardust-in-pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Ways to increase stardust in pokemon go?"></a>Part 3: Ways to increase stardust in pokemon go?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 1\.

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132161/7443" target="_top" id="2132161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132161/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?<p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

Developed by Niantic for iOS and Android, this single console game lets us catch all sorts of Pokemons in different areas. Though, to catch Pokemons, users are expected to visit different places and step out. Needless to say, it restricts the scope to <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/pokemon-go/best-pokemon-type.html" >catch Pokemons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and users often look for Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android.

As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.</p><p>If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2135473/26400" target="_top" id="2135473">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2135473" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135473/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020<p>A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android’s features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.</p><ul><li>If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won’t sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.</li><li>The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.</li><li>The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account.

Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.</p><p>Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here’s how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Pokemon Go on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G and create your account if you haven’t already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can’t detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device again and access the new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg"                      alt="vpn for android"                ></p><h3 id="3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go"><a href="#3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Use Fake GPS Go"></a>3.2 Use Fake GPS Go</h3><p>If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; System &gt; About Phone and tap on the “Build Number” option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="Fake GPS Go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137228/26400" target="_top" id="2137228">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137228" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137228/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->**Step 2.** Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access.

As the name suggests it is a feature in Pokémon Go that lets you battle as a trainer against the other trainers. Pokémon Go trainer battles are a great way to enhance your skills as the rules are different from the gym and raid battles which are also a great feature of this game. The Pokémon CP limits are granted to each league from which the trainer needs to choose one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135418/19272" target="_top" id="2135418">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135418" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135418/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118318/7443" target="_top" id="2118318">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118318" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118318/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?<p>The best part is that the teams are assembled by the trainers themselves. The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 2"                ></p><p>Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136622/26400" target="_top" id="2136622">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136622" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136622/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?<p>This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight. There are three different types of rewards that you can win when it comes to trainer battles. These are as follows:</p><ul><li>Stardust</li><li>As of January 2019, the Rare Candy reward has also been introduced to make the battles more enchanting.</li><li>1 in 7 chance of Sinnoh Stone.</li></ul><p>No matter that you win or lose a battle these rewards are credited to your account. If you are playing with a computer the threshold to get the rewards is 1. If you are competing with the other players then the rewards can be earned thrice per day. Both the participants will get the same rewards but the abilities are different depending on the fact that whether you are a winner or loser. The Ace trainer medal and its acquaintance will also get the level up with each battle that you win. The other three medals will also get a level up as per a blog post from Niantic. These medals are as follows:</p><ul><li>Great League Veteran</li><li>Ultra League Veteran</li><li>Master League Veteran.</li></ul><p>The rematches that are done in the trainer battles also account for the leveling up in all the medals as well as the other rewards that are explained.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 3"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-CP-Matter-in-Trainer-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-Does-CP-Matter-in-Trainer-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?"></a>Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?</h2><p>In Pokémon trainer battle it indeed matters and this is one of the basic phenomena that will take you and your team to the next level. The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles"></a>Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles</h2><p>To get the best out of Pokémon Go battle another trainer it is advised to get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pokémon.</li><li><strong>Trade with other players.</strong> If you have friends who also play Pokémon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pokémon with them. Just make sure you’re in a specific range with them.</li><li><strong>Use incense and lures.</strong> Both of these will help you attract more Pokémon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.</li><li><strong>Play on the Community Days.</strong> If you’re looking to catch a Shiny Pokémon, don’t forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!</li><li><strong>Have friends in other regions.</strong> You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pokémon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pokémon with each other.</li><li><strong>Use a virtual GPS at home.</strong> If you don’t have anyone to trade your regional Pokémon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pokémon!</li></ul><p>Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pokémon.

href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to imitate your orientation without making a move and collect exclusive Pokémon. The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install:</strong></p><p>Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect:</strong></p><p>Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:</strong></p><p>Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu.

It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Let’s Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.</p><p>The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-home-vs-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon home vs pokemon go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328679">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328679">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328679%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328679/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Conclusion<p>Pokémon is one of the most enjoyable games, not only because it yields prizes such as the mystery box Pokémon, Meltan Pokémon, shiny Meltan Pokémon go, but it also develops players’ interest completely.

You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.</p><p>Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn’t just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.</p><p>Once you defeat Team Go Rocket’s second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn’t be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.</p><p>Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014857/22899" target="_top" id="2014857">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014857" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014857/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3.

For this purpose, follow the step-by-step guide below and learn to change your virtual location with Wondershare Dr.Fone:</p><ul><li>Step 1. Launch Dr.Fone and Access Teleport Mode</li></ul><p>Establish the connection of your phone to the PC or MacBook upon launching Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. Then, move ahead by choosing “Teleport Mode” in the upper right section. This option is the first icon from left to right within that section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="navigate teleport mode dr.fone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129741/7443" target="_top" id="2129741">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129741" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129741/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->- Step 2. Find the Location To Spoof Using the Search Bar<p>Once Teleport Mode is activated, head to the top left side, access the search bar, and type the required location. Then, hit the “Enter” key to mark that location on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="search for required location"                ></p><ul><li>Step 3. Adjust the Pin Location and Confirm Your Choice</li></ul><p>Following this, verify the location information displayed on the screen. Use the “Move Here” button to confirm your location, which also changes the location of your smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="confirm select location to move"                ></p><ul><li>Step 4. Try the One-Route Function for Destination Location</li></ul><p>To use this feature, navigate to the upper-right section and tap the “One-Stop Route” icon. It is denoted by the third icon from the left. As you’ve already been teleported to a different location, simply tap on any point on the map to designate it as your destination.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="navigate one-stop route option"                ></p><ul><li>Step 5. Adjust and Start Simulation Parameters</li></ul><p>Upon selecting, decide whether you want a “Round Trip” or “Loop Trip,” and enter the number of times you want the trip. Now, drag the slider to choose the speed of spoofing and proceed by tapping on the “Move Here” button. Afterward, the simulation will start, so you can witness your movement now.

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115934/19272" target="_top" id="2115934">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115934" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115934/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?<p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

A Troubling Situation Task<p>This four-step storyline Special Research task introduces players to the Team Go Rocket Invasion and Shadow Pokemon feature in the Pokemon Go game. Players leverage the task to learn how to stop the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate by reclaiming PokeStop and then purifying Shadow Pokemon.</p><p>How to Complete ’A Troubling Situation’ Task in Pokemon Go Giovani</p><p>Below you will find all the four steps you need to complete in the ‘A Troubling Situation’ task with their rewards:</p><p><strong>Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 1</strong></p><p>This step should be completed with ease since you aren’t new to the Giovani Pokemon Go game. Just evolve any two Pokemon that you own and then charge them up five times. And boom! You are done with this step.</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> 1,000 Stardust and 2,000 XP</p><p><strong>Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 2</strong></p><p>For this step, you have to catch two shadow Pokemon which can be achieved by defeating two Grunts from Team Go Rocket. On killing them, they will leave some shadow Pokemon behind which you have to catch. After that, go ahead and defeat the last Grunt to complete this step.</p><p><strong>Reward:</strong> 2,000 Stardust, 2,000 XP, and 5 Golden Razz Berries</p><p><strong>Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 3</strong></p><p>After catching the shadow Pokemon in step 2, you need to catch one more to cleanse or purify the three of them. To do this, just tap on your shadow Pokemon, and then hit the Purify option. You will be charged some thousands of Stardust and a couple of candy for the shadow Pokemon.</p><p><strong>Rewards:</strong> 2000 Stardust, 5 Silver Pinap Berries, and 1 Rare Candy</p><p><strong>Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 4</strong></p><p>For this step, you’ve got nothing to do. All three objectives have been automatically completed for you when you finished the previous step. You only get rewards at this final step.</p><p><strong>Rewards:</strong> One Fast TM, One Charged TM, and 3 Rare Candies</p><h3 id="2-Giovani-Special-Research-Task"><a href="#2-Giovani-Special-Research-Task" class="headerlink" title="2.

It’s a six-step Special Research that introduces the Team Go Rocket Grunts and Leaders: Cliff, Arlo, and Sierra.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/a-troubling-situation-task.jpg"                      alt="a troubling situation task"                ></p><p>On completing one research step, you will be given a reward called the Super Rocket Radar.

What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?<p>Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.</p><p>The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.</p><p>Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Lineup of Creature</th><th>Pokemon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First</td><td>Persian</td></tr><tr><td>Second</td><td>Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp</td></tr><tr><td>Third</td><td>Mewtwo</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.</p><p>When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.</p><p>Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn’t just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.</p><p>Once you defeat Team Go Rocket’s second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn’t be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.</p><p>Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135356/19272" target="_top" id="2135356">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135356" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135356/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3.

With that, you can use the same Pokemon twice, thereby keeping your choice for Legendary Shadow Pokemon safe till you need it to beat Giovani.</p><p>Mind you, the big bad boss, Giovani has two Protect Shields at his disposal so you have to be careful while fighting against the monster. We implore you to start your game with a Pokemon that has a Charged move so you can charge as fast as possible.</p><p>Getting a strong Pokemon won’t come with ease, however, with the use of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone- Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can achieve this.

It’s an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won’t be able to download <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong> at all.</p><p>However, the good news is that you don’t need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that’ll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you’ll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137974/21526" target="_top" id="2137974">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137974" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137974/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## ****Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android****<p>When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you’ll have to be extra cautious. <em>Why?</em> Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren’t reliable and may damage your smartphone’s overall functionality as well.</p><p>Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.</p><ol><li><strong>Use VMOS</strong></li></ol><p>VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you’ll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you’ll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg"                      alt="vmos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975658">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975658">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975658.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975658%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975658/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->The only downside of using VMOS is that it’s extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you’ll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn’t have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.<ol start="2"><li><strong>Root Your Device</strong></li></ol><p>Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you’ll root your device, you won’t be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don’t want to void your smartphone’s warranty, ‘rooting’ may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Use PGSharp</strong></li></ol><p>PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong>. It’s a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick. The best part about using PGSharp is that it’s compatible with all Android devices. You won’t have to root your device to install and run PGSharp.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp"                ></p><p>You can either choose the free or the paid version of the app. Of course, the latter comes with a few additional features, but if you only want to fake location in Pokemon Go, the free version of PGSharp will get the job done as well.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that PGSharp isn’t available on Google Play Store and you’ll have to download it from the official <a href="https://www.pgsharp.com/"><u>PGSharp website</u></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123901/26106" target="_top" id="2123901">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123901" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123901/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## **Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location**<p>So, that’s how you can fake GPS location on an Android device and collect different types of Pokemon in Pokemon Go. Even though iSPoofer isn’t available for Android, you can still use the above three methods to mock location without any effort.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that iSpoofer is permanently shut down and you can no longer install it on iOS devices as well. Even the iSpoofer website is down and if you want to fake location on your iPhone&#x2F;iPad, you’ll have to look for other options. One of the best ways to change GPS location on an iOS device is to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). It’s a professional geo spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a wide variety of features to mock location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5Gs.</p><p>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that’ll allow you to change your current location to anywhere in the world. You can even set a fake location using its GPS coordinates. Like iSpoofer, <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</u></a> also comes with the GPS Joystick feature. This means you’ll be able to catch different types of Pokemon without moving at all.</p><p>Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).</p><ul><li>Change your current location with a single click</li><li>Use GPS coordinates to find locations</li><li>Virtually control your GPS movement using the Joystick feature</li><li>Customize your movement speed while walking in different directions</li><li>Compatible with all iOS versions</li></ul><p>Follow these steps to change your GPS location on an iDevice using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Step 1 - Install the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and launch the software.

Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/c/5597632/2114263/17093" target="_top" id="2114263">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17093-2114263" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettiit.sjv.io/i/5597632/2114263/17093"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->    To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”.

Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick.

After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:</p><ul><li><p>Stay Safe Indoors</p><p>  Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.</p></li><li><p>Move Beyond your Area</p><p>  If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.</p></li><li><p>Catch More Pokemons</p><p>  One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!</p></li><li><p>Level-up in the Game Easily</p><p>  From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.</p></li><li><p>Have a Better Gaming Experience</p><p>  Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks"><a href="#Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?"></a><strong>Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?</strong></h2><p>While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.</p><ul><li><p>Account Ban by Niantic</p><p>  Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135418/19272" target="_top" id="2135418">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135418" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135418/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->    To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”.

This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.</code></pre><ul><li><p>The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down</p><p>  Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.</p></li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely.

Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution<p>With almost 60 Pokemon GO regional exclusives in 2024, keeping track of where each creature spawns can be a nightmare, especially when some Pokemon can only be found in tiny and specific areas. However, you don’t necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.</p><h3 id="Getting-Information-From-the-Community"><a href="#Getting-Information-From-the-Community" class="headerlink" title="Getting Information From the Community"></a>Getting Information From the Community</h3><p>The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community.

With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon<p>As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.</p><p>However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.</p><p>Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/new-navigating-nocturnal-images-on-iphones/"><u>[New] Navigating Nocturnal Images on iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-social-network-video-download-for-audio-conversion/"><u>2024 Approved  Social Network Video Download for Audio Conversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/4-feasible-ways-to-fake-location-on-facebook-for-your-motorola-moto-g04-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 Feasible Ways to Fake Location on Facebook For your Motorola Moto G04 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-mega-greninja-for-realme-c67-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>All You Need To Know About Mega Greninja For Realme C67 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/catch-or-beat-sleeping-snorlax-on-pokemon-go-for-honor-x7b-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Catch or Beat Sleeping Snorlax on Pokemon Go For Honor X7b | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/disabling-apple-iphone-se-parental-restrictions-withwithout-password-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Disabling Apple iPhone SE Parental Restrictions With/Without Password</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/essential-10-fcp-plugin-tools-for-2024/"><u>Essential 10 FCP Plugin Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-for-realme-v30t-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Realme V30T | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-android-lock-screen-using-emergency-call-on-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Android Lock Screen Using Emergency Call On Samsung Galaxy A15 4G?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-go-joystick-on-realme-11-proplus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to use Pokemon Go Joystick on Realme 11 Pro+?

The three leagues are commonly called the Great League, Ultra League, and Master League. During leagues, there is a certain limit of using the combat power (CP) of Pokémon. Each league requires Pokémon with different CP restrictions and strategies compared with others.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>Pokémon GO PvP</strong> is designed to use an array of Pokémon in a particular league. Notably, you can use only three Pokémon while fighting in a league. Read this article to stay updated about the leagues and achieve the maximum rewards and ranking. By the end, you will also get familiar with the 15 strongest <strong>Pokémon GO PvP</strong> and a robust location spoofer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-strongest-pokemon-in-go-pvp-leagues-1.jpg"                      alt="finding strongest pokemon for pvp league"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130890/7443" target="_top" id="2130890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 1. What Are the Limitations of CP for Every Pokémon GO PvP League<p>For a diverse and challenging gaming experience, <strong>Pokémon GO PvP</strong> comes up with CP limitations. So far, the Great League is easier to start because players with a limit of 1500 CP Pokémon can participate. Then comes the Ultra League, where you’ll find more legendary Pokémon due to its 2500 CP limitation. Unlike other leagues, there is no Pokémon CP limitation in the Master League.</p><p>In addition, these three Pokémon GO leagues often feature themed cups. For instance, Master League Classic is more likely to feature Pokémon with no CP limit but excludes Pokémon powered up with Candy XL and Legendary Pokémon. Anyhow, you can go through the table given below to memorize the CP limit for PvP leagues instantly:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Battle Leagues</strong></th><th><strong>CP Limit</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pokémon GO Great League</strong></td><td>1500 CP Limit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon GO Ultra League</strong></td><td>2500 CP Limit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon GO Master League</strong></td><td>No CP limit</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983573">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983573">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983573.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983573%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983573/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2. 5 Strongest Pokémon for Pokémon GO Great League<p>Start your Pokémon Go Battle by tapping the Poke Ball and Battle option.

What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?<p>Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.</p><p>The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.</p><p>Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Lineup of Creature</th><th>Pokemon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First</td><td>Persian</td></tr><tr><td>Second</td><td>Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp</td></tr><tr><td>Third</td><td>Mewtwo</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.</p><p>When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.</p><p>Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn’t just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.</p><p>Once you defeat Team Go Rocket’s second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn’t be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.</p><p>Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137227/26400" target="_top" id="2137227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137227/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3.

Great League<p>The Great League is the easiest league to jump into for beginners. Here, only Pokémon with 1,500 CP or less can join the battle. This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134221/18498" target="_top" id="2134221">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134221" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134221/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2\.

Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.</p><p>In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983552">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983552.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983552">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983552.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983552%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983552/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 3\.

The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you’re soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.</p><p>What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?"></a>Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?</h2><p>When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?</h2><h3 id="1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down"><a href="#1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down" class="headerlink" title="1.

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.<p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

If you combine Dawn Stone with certain Pokémon, they will evolve to another level. This peculiar stone was introduced in Generation IV, and in terms of appearance, Dawn Stone sparkles like a glittering eye.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/dawn-stone.jpg"                      alt="dawn stone"                ></p><p>You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.</p><h3 id="Pokemon-that-Evolve-with-Dawn-Stone"><a href="#Pokemon-that-Evolve-with-Dawn-Stone" class="headerlink" title="Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone"></a>Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone</h3><p>As aforementioned, dawn stone is an evolution item that is used to evolve certain species of Pokémon. To evolve your Pokémon using Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield, enter the bag menu and choose the “Other Items” tab. Hover on the Dawn Stone and select the “Use this item” option. Finally, select the Pokémon to evolve. These Pokémon that can be evolved using dawn stone include:</p><h3 id="1-Kirlia"><a href="#1-Kirlia" class="headerlink" title="1. Kirlia"></a>1. Kirlia</h3><p>Kirlia is a small humanoid Pokémon whose upper body and arms are white while the waist and legs are light green. This makes it appear as though it is wearing tights. Kirlia’s natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.</p><h3 id="2-Snorunt"><a href="#2-Snorunt" class="headerlink" title="2. Snorunt"></a>2. Snorunt</h3><p>Snorunt is an ice-type Pokémon that was introduced in Generation III. It is also referred to as the “Snow Hat Pokémon.” You can find Snorunt in seafoam café, snow canyon, or even in Mysterious Grotto. Furthermore, you can obtain it by trading or Pokémon Roulette. Snorunt can evolve into Glalie or Froslass. If it reaches level 42, Snorunt evolves to Glalie. For Snorunt to evolve into Froslass, it requires a dawn stone. However, the Snorunt must be a female to evolve to Froslass.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Hacks-and-Tricks-to-get-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-2-Hacks-and-Tricks-to-get-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Evolving your Pokémon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.</p><p>Now, while some of your Pokémon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pokémon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive – one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.</p><p><strong>Pokémon Go Sun Stone evolutions</strong> can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You’ll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pokémon. Depending on the species, you’ll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don’t worry, evolutions don’t affect the total number of Pokémon in your collection).</p><p>Depending on the specific Pokémon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).</p><p>You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones"><a href="#Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Only the lucky few are able to come across it randomly, as it comes with a mere 1% drop chance.</p><p>Fortunately, for all those unlucky ones, you can acquire the Sun Stone to complete your Pokémon evolutions in a few different ways.</p><h3 id="Special-Events"><a href="#Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="Special Events"></a>Special Events</h3><p>Partaking in Pokémon Go special events is almost always a lucrative experience. You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pokémon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:</p><ul><li>Lunar New Year – February 5 to February 11;</li><li>Carnival of Love – February 13 to February 15;</li><li>Road to Sinnoh – February 19 to February 23.</li></ul><p>You’ll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a Sun Stone, there’s always a possibility!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983553%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983553/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Field Research<p>Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pokémon, so he’ll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.</p><p>As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.</p><h3 id="Special-Research"><a href="#Special-Research" class="headerlink" title="Special Research"></a>Special Research</h3><p>With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.</p><p>Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.</p><p>As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2005183/22899" target="_top" id="2005183">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2005183" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2005183/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Gyms and PokeStops<p>Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.</p><p>While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.</p><p>Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

However, that doesn’t mean you’ll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.</p><h3 id="Complete-Field-Research-Tasks-Quickly"><a href="#Complete-Field-Research-Tasks-Quickly" class="headerlink" title="Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly"></a>Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly</h3><p>Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.</p><p>To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you’ll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly.

You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters.

Now that you know about the Pokémon Go 100 IV maps that actually work, you can easily catch these powerful Pokémon. Though, after noting their coordinates from a Pokémon IV 100 map, you would need to use a location spoofer app. I would recommend <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since it is pretty easy to use and will not need any jailbreak access as well.

If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Great League:</strong> Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Ultra League:</strong> Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Master League:</strong> No CP limit</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="leagues in pokemon pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123736/7443" target="_top" id="2123736">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123736" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123736/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons.

The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.</p><ul><li><strong>Fast attacks:</strong> These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.</li><li><strong>Charge attack:</strong> Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.</li><li><strong>Shield:</strong> This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.</li><li><strong>Swapping:</strong> Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123739/7443" target="_top" id="2123739">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123739" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123739/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons<p>This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/opponent-screen-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="opponent screen pokemon pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115915/19272" target="_top" id="2115915">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115915" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115915/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Tip 4: Know the current Meta<p>In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.</p><p>There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1155462">                    <video width="1024" height="576" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1155462">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1155462.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:640px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fpropmoneyinc.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1155462%2F14559'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1155462/14559"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy<p>This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.</p><p>Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves"><a href="#Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves"></a>Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves</h3><p>To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.</p><p>During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack.

For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.</p><p>In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?<p>Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.</p><ul><li>The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.</li><li>Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.</li><li>Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.</li><li>The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.</li><li>The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-iv-level-trick-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="cp iv level trick pokemon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?<p>During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Team composition</strong></li></ul><p>Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.</p><ul><li><strong>Focus on attacks</strong></li></ul><p>Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider Pokemon Stats</strong></li></ul><p>Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice. Besides that, you should also do some research about the Meta tier in Pokemon PvP to know the best picks of the present time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg"                      alt="meta pokemons in pvp"                ></p><p>Most of the experts consider the following points while picking any Pokemon in PvP battles.</p><ul><li><strong>Lead</strong></li></ul><p>Firstly, focus on getting a Pokemon that can help you maintain a lead in the battle right from the start. You can consider getting Altaria, Deoxys, or Mantine as they are the strongest attackers.</p><ul><li><strong>Attacker</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to fight more aggressively in the Pokemon PvP battle, then consider getting some attackers like Bastiodon, Medicham, and Whiscash.</p><ul><li><strong>Defender</strong></li></ul><p>While making your Pokemon PvP team, make sure that you have at least one strong defender like Froslass, Zweilous, or Swampert.</p><ul><li><strong>Closer</strong></li></ul><p>In the end, make sure that you have a perfect Pokemon that can end the battle and secure a win. Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="skarmory in pokemon go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137973/21526" target="_top" id="2137973">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137973" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137973/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles<p>Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.</p><ul><li><strong>Turns</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong></li></ul><p>You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.</p><ul><li><strong>Switching</strong></li></ul><p>Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mechanism-in-pokemon-pvp-battle.jpg"                      alt="mechanism in pokemon pvp battle"                ></p><p>There you go!

These files are saved in ‘XML’ format, which makes it easy to import and read GPS data by several programs.</p><p><strong>How to download gpx file on iOS and Android</strong></p><p>On iOS</p><p>First, open the route that you are interested in, then select the ‘Export gpx’ option &gt; ‘Export’ in the lower line. Next, choose whether to forward the gpx file via a provider or to copy and save it in your data.</p><p>On Android</p><p>Open the route you are interested in and hit the ‘More’ option. Next, select the ‘Export gps’ option and the file will be downloaded to your smartphone. You can forward the route to various providers by tapping the ‘Share’ button.</p><p><strong>Why gpx Pokemon</strong></p><p>Many games have thronged our screens but not many matches Pokemon. Once you download gpx to iTools mobile, you get real-life benefits from this hottest virtual game.

It lives up to that and has a mega evolution that makes Mewtwo even stronger when compared to its original form. The Pokemon can learn powerful psychic moves, such as confusion and recover.</p><p>Frankly, Mewtwo can be located only in the Cerulean Cave that further locates in Kanto. That’s why you cannot find Mewtwo in Platinum. And, if you want to obtain Mewtwo, you have to migrate or trade for one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/Platinum-legendaries-14.png"                      alt="Platinum legendaries 14"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1938136">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1938136">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1938136.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1938136%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1938136/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->According to some users, you can get Mewtwo with Pokemon Fire Red or Leaf Green.

Fixed<p>The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123738/7443" target="_top" id="2123738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working<p>Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2128843/7443" target="_top" id="2128843">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2128843" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2128843/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue<p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Install the Official Version:</strong> It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.</li></ul><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location"><a href="#Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location"></a>Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location</h2><p>If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use. You can employ a much simpler and easier to install GPS mocking application like Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock the Developer Options settings"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go.

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Realme 12 Pro+ 5G service on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2129738/7443" target="_top" id="2129738">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2129738" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2129738/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users<p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts.

Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129042/19576" target="_top" id="2129042">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129042" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129042/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go<p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975562">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975562">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975562%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975562/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go<p>Do you have a turntable? If yes, you are lucky! You can use it that you used to listen to music to trick Pokemon Go that you’re walking and hatch the eggs. Because the turntable creates enough motion in a wide enough circle that it will trick your phone’s internal sensors into thinking you’re walking. This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:</p><p>Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable &gt; Turn on the turntable &gt; Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch. If not, readjust your device and try again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking.jpg"                      alt="play pokemon go with turntable"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Tired of walking to hatch eggs?

These eggs can be obtained by visiting PokeStops or by receiving them as rewards for completing certain in-game tasks. Once an egg is collected, you must walk a certain distance (ranging from 2 to 12 kilometers) to hatch the egg and reveal the Pokemon inside. You can use the ways mentioned above to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking.</p><p>The types of eggs that can be collected in Pokemon Go include:</p><ol><li>2 km eggs - These eggs typically hatch common Pokemon, such as Pidgey or Caterpie.</li><li>5 km eggs - These eggs can hatch a range of Pokemon, including some starters like Charmander and Squirtle, as well as rarer species like Dratini.</li><li>7 km eggs - These eggs usually contain baby Pokemon, like Pichu or Togepi, as well as some Alolan forms.</li><li>10 km eggs - These eggs are the rarest and can hatch some of the strongest and most sought-after Pokémon, such as Snorlax, Lapras, and even certain legendary Pokemon like Moltres or Zapdos.</li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135365/19272" target="_top" id="2135365">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135365" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135365/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Conclusion<p>Now that you know <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> in 9 different ways, using a professional location spoofer(like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ), you can easily be a Poke master for sure.

If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go.

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123750/7443" target="_top" id="2123750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123750/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->**Things to Remember**<ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Realme 12 Pro+ 5G service on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts.

While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go<p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><h2 id="Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123508/26400" target="_top" id="2123508">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123508" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123508/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135366/19272" target="_top" id="2135366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go<p>Do you have a turntable? If yes, you are lucky! You can use it that you used to listen to music to trick Pokemon Go that you’re walking and hatch the eggs.

This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:</p><p>Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable &gt; Turn on the turntable &gt; Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch.

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.<p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115942/19272" target="_top" id="2115942">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115942" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115942/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?<p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).</p><p>You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones"><a href="#Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

While partaking in a special event doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a Sun Stone, there’s always a possibility!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118320/7443" target="_top" id="2118320">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118320" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118320/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Field Research<p>Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pokémon, so he’ll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.</p><p>As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.</p><h3 id="Special-Research"><a href="#Special-Research" class="headerlink" title="Special Research"></a>Special Research</h3><p>With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.</p><p>Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.</p><p>As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.</p><h3 id="Gyms-and-PokeStops"><a href="#Gyms-and-PokeStops" class="headerlink" title="Gyms and PokeStops"></a>Gyms and PokeStops</h3><p>Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.</p><p>While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.</p><p>Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

However, that doesn’t mean you’ll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.</p><h3 id="Complete-Field-Research-Tasks-Quickly"><a href="#Complete-Field-Research-Tasks-Quickly" class="headerlink" title="Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly"></a>Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly</h3><p>Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.</p><p>To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you’ll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.</p><p>You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.</p><p>To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:</p><ol><li>Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;</li><li>Connect your phone to your computer;</li><li>Go to <strong>Toolbox &gt; Virtual Location &gt; Get Started</strong>;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="get started with wondershare dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>On the map that shows up, click on <strong>No Device</strong>in the upper right-hand corner;</li><li>You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png"                      alt="choose the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device you want to connect to dr.fone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136620/26400" target="_top" id="2136620">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136620" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136620/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->6.

Pokémon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you’ll always want to know precisely when they start and end.</p><p>Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pokémon Go on social media or visit the official Pokémon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Acquiring Sun Stones for Pokémon evolutions can be quite a hassle. This rare evolution item can be a tricky find. Still, simply playing the game and joining all events, completing your research tasks, and more can significantly increase your chances of coming across a Sun Stone – especially if you have the help of apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-youtube-video-enhancement-with-wmm/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Step-by-Step Guide to YouTube Video Enhancement with WMM</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-unleash-the-full-potential-of-your-images-with-powerful-pixlr-hacks/"><u>[New] Unleash the Full Potential of Your Images with Powerful Pixlr Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-new-vloggers-guide-to-top-10-youtube-editing-techniques/"><u>[Updated] New Vloggers' Guide to Top 10 YouTube Editing Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/3-ways-for-android-pokemon-go-spoofing-on-realme-narzo-60x-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing On Realme Narzo 60x 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/4-solution-to-get-rid-of-pokemon-fail-to-detect-location-on-honor-magic5-ultimate-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 solution to get rid of pokemon fail to detect location On Honor Magic5 Ultimate | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-quick-fixes-unfortunately-snapchat-has-stopped-on-motorola-moto-g84-5g-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Quick Fixes Unfortunately, Snapchat has Stopped on Motorola Moto G84 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/a-working-guide-for-pachirisu-pokemon-go-map-on-tecno-pova-6-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-mega-greninja-for-google-pixel-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>All You Need To Know About Mega Greninja For Google Pixel 8 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-mega-greninja-for-honor-x50-gt-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>All You Need To Know About Mega Greninja For Honor X50 GT | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/experience-unmatched-reliability-the-upgraded-nighthawk-x6s-wireless-range-extender-by-netgear/"><u>Experience Unmatched Reliability - The Upgraded Nighthawk X6S Wireless Range Extender by Netgear</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/full-guide-to-catch-100-iv-pokemon-using-a-map-on-realme-c33-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Full Guide to Catch 100 IV Pokémon Using a Map On Realme C33 2023 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-a-damaged-video-file-of-vivo-y100i-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>How to Repair a Damaged video file of Vivo Y100i?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-go-joystick-on-realme-12plus-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to use Pokemon Go Joystick on Realme 12+ 5G?

Players get to be a part of the various regions of the Pokemon has now become one with our world. The game requires you to travel to different locations to complete researches, catch Pokemon, defend gyms, and most importantly, complete the Pokedex given by Professor Willow. Niantic’s games are designed to be played with others outdoors. This feature ends up giving players in some parts of the world advantage over others. This is specially to catch regional Pokemon and during ticketed events and sponsored events. Spoofers can avoid the barriers of distance and play anywhere in the world by iSpoofer for pogo installation and other such apps. Niantic, however, does not allow this and considers it the same as hacking. Players who were looking to play and access all the features of the game available all across the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-the-iSpoofer-back-on-2020"><a href="#Part-1-Will-the-iSpoofer-back-on-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?"></a>Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?</h2><p>iSpoofer has been shut down. All its applications, websites, and other related services have been terminated. iSpoofer for pogo installation does not exist. If any website claims to give access to the application or iSpoofer direct download, it is fake. Also, the new Pokemon Go application version which is 0.195.0 has been updated to detect applications like iSpoofer, so on being detected, it may lead to a warning, or a permanent ban as well. And we don’t see the certainty to get it back soon.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-guide-of-iSpoofer-for-pogo-installation"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-guide-of-iSpoofer-for-pogo-installation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation"></a>Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation</h2><p>This detailed guide for iSpoofer installation is for those who still possess the older version of the app that works in an older iOS version.</p><p><strong>Step 1 –</strong> Install the setup for iSpoofer on your computer if you had got it using.

You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Great League:</strong> Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Ultra League:</strong> Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Master League:</strong> No CP limit</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="leagues in pokemon pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977032">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977032">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977032.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977032%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977032/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons.

The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.</p><ul><li><strong>Fast attacks:</strong> These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.</li><li><strong>Charge attack:</strong> Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.</li><li><strong>Shield:</strong> This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.</li><li><strong>Swapping:</strong> Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons"><a href="#Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons"></a>Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons</h3><p>This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league.

You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.</p><p>There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy"><a href="#Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy"></a>Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy</h3><p>This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.</p><p>Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098704/14409" target="_top" id="2098704">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098704" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098704/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983475">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983475">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983475%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983475/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves<p>To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.</p><p>During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/fast-moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="fast moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap"><a href="#Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap"></a>Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap</h3><p>This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.</p><p>In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126493/26400" target="_top" id="2126493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126493/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?<p>Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.</p><ul><li>The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.</li><li>Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.</li><li>Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.</li><li>The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.</li><li>The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-iv-level-trick-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="cp iv level trick pokemon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977004">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977004">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977004.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977004%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977004/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?<p>During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Team composition</strong></li></ul><p>Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.</p><ul><li><strong>Focus on attacks</strong></li></ul><p>Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider Pokemon Stats</strong></li></ul><p>Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice. Besides that, you should also do some research about the Meta tier in Pokemon PvP to know the best picks of the present time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg"                      alt="meta pokemons in pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983471">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983471">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983471.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983471%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983471/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Most of the experts consider the following points while picking any Pokemon in PvP battles.<ul><li><strong>Lead</strong></li></ul><p>Firstly, focus on getting a Pokemon that can help you maintain a lead in the battle right from the start.

Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="skarmory in pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.</p><ul><li><strong>Turns</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong></li></ul><p>You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.</p><ul><li><strong>Switching</strong></li></ul><p>Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mechanism-in-pokemon-pvp-battle.jpg"                      alt="mechanism in pokemon pvp battle"                ></p><p>There you go!

It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.</p></li><li><p>Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.</p></li><li><p>Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-10.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Cooldown Chart"                ></p></li><li><p>Make sure that the Pokemon Go joystick you are using is a reliable solution (like the ones listed above).</p></li><li><p>If you have already got a warning on your Pokemon Go account, then consider creating another account for using any fake GPS Pokemon Go hack instead.</p></li></ul><p>There you go! By now, you would be able to implement these spoofing Pokemon Go tips and tricks. As you can see, there can be so many Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solutions that you can explore.

This is useful for games like Pokemon Go, where you can catch Pokemons from different regions without leaving your home. However, iSpoofer is not available for download anymore. If you are looking for an alternative to iSpoofer, you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location. Here’s how you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location to spoof your location on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png"                      alt="avatar"                ></a></p><p>iSpoofer is one of the most useful tools for iOS users, that’s designed to simulate a user’s GPS location. With iSpoofer, you can change your current location to anywhere in the world and access geo-restricted content without any hassle. While the tool has several real-world applications, the majority of users use iSpoofer to fake their location to catch rare Pokemon in Pokemon Go.</p><p>Since iSpoofer is an extremely reliable app, even Android users want to know if they can use it on their smartphones or not. If you’re one of them, this guide will help. In today’s article, we are going to discuss if you can download <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong> or not and what are some of the best solutions to fake GPS location on an Android device.</p><p>So, without any further ado, let’s get started.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part1" >Part 1: Can I download the iSpoofer on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part2" >Part 2: Common ways to spoof on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983582">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983582.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983582">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983582.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983582%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983582/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## ****Part 1:  Can I download the iSpoofer on Android****<p>Unfortunately, iSpoofer isn’t available for Android. It’s an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won’t be able to download <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong> at all.</p><p>However, the good news is that you don’t need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that’ll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you’ll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Common-ways-to-spoof-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Common-ways-to-spoof-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android"></a><strong><strong>Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android</strong></strong></h2><p>When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you’ll have to be extra cautious. <em>Why?</em> Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren’t reliable and may damage your smartphone’s overall functionality as well.</p><p>Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.</p><ol><li><strong>Use VMOS</strong></li></ol><p>VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you’ll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you’ll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg"                      alt="vmos"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->The only downside of using VMOS is that it’s extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you’ll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn’t have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.<ol start="2"><li><strong>Root Your Device</strong></li></ol><p>Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you’ll root your device, you won’t be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don’t want to void your smartphone’s warranty, ‘rooting’ may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Use PGSharp</strong></li></ol><p>PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong>. It’s a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick.

Even though iSPoofer isn’t available for Android, you can still use the above three methods to mock location without any effort.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that iSpoofer is permanently shut down and you can no longer install it on iOS devices as well. Even the iSpoofer website is down and if you want to fake location on your iPhone&#x2F;iPad, you’ll have to look for other options. One of the best ways to change GPS location on an iOS device is to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). It’s a professional geo spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a wide variety of features to mock location on Realme 12 Pro+ 5Gs.</p><p>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that’ll allow you to change your current location to anywhere in the world. You can even set a fake location using its GPS coordinates. Like iSpoofer, <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</u></a> also comes with the GPS Joystick feature. This means you’ll be able to catch different types of Pokemon without moving at all.</p><p>Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).</p><ul><li>Change your current location with a single click</li><li>Use GPS coordinates to find locations</li><li>Virtually control your GPS movement using the Joystick feature</li><li>Customize your movement speed while walking in different directions</li><li>Compatible with all iOS versions</li></ul><p>Follow these steps to change your GPS location on an iDevice using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Step 1 - Install the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and launch the software.

Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.</p><p>Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here’s how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Pokemon Go on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G and create your account if you haven’t already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can’t detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device again and access the new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg"                      alt="vpn for android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury" target="_top" id="2120863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120863/26400?prodsku=Mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 3.2 Use Fake GPS Go<p>If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; System &gt; About Phone and tap on the “Build Number” option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg"                      alt="select Fake GPS Go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139558/4704" target="_top" id="2139558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139558/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->**Step 3.** That's it!

These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It’ll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Trading in Pokemon go was introduced in recent times and had now become one of the most integral factors of the game. Pokemon go trading has changed the gaming trend. However, you could get an upper hand by using a virtual location changer such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This can help you to even trade pokemons seamlessly with friends staying at far-off places. Using the pokemon trade feature and evolving pokemons is a smart and handy way to progress further in the game. As a Pokemon go player, you must try it out!</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-boosting-engagement-the-art-of-sharing-videos-on-instagram/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Boosting Engagement  The Art of Sharing Videos on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-should-itop-screen-recorder-be-a-staple-in-your-kit/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Should ITop Screen Recorder Be a Staple in Your Kit?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-the-seamless-swivel-rotating-your-media-masterpieces-on-social-sites-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Seamless Swivel  Rotating Your Media Masterpieces on Social Sites for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-video-management-made-easy-the-best-practices-in-mov-on-win-11/"><u>[New] Video Management Made Easy  The Best Practices in .MOV on Win 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-non-youtube-video-editing-discover-the-top-5-newcomers/"><u>[Updated] Non-YouTube Video Editing  Discover the Top 5 Newcomers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tricks-and-tips-for-mastering-your-new-win11-experience/"><u>2024 Approved  Tricks & Tips for Mastering Your New Win11 Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-framework-for-engaging-fb-giving-campaigns/"><u>A Step-by-Step Framework for Engaging FB Giving Campaigns</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-honor-v-purse-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>CatchEmAll Celebrate National Pokémon Day with Virtual Location On Honor V Purse | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/crypto-clout-how-much-does-the-youtube-gamer-make-in-2024/"><u>Crypto Clout  How Much Does the YouTube Gamer Make, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/download-wacom-drivers-instantly-the-fastest-way/"><u>Download Wacom Drivers Instantly - The Fastest Way</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-and-where-to-find-a-shiny-stone-pokemon-for-realme-c33-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How and Where to Find a Shiny Stone Pokémon For Realme C33 2023?
