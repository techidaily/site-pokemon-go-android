So you can go to ASUS official website to download chipset drivers for Windows 10 depending on your PC model name. If ASUS does not support Windows 10 for your PC model, you can try downloading drivers for Windows 8 or Windows 7, which are always compatible for Windows 10.</p><p> If you don’t have time, patience or computer skills to update ACPI drivers manually, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .</p><p> Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.</p><p> You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy.

As the name suggests it is a feature in Pokémon Go that lets you battle as a trainer against the other trainers.

The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon go hacks 2"                ></p><p>Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921"                      border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?"></a>Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?</h2><p>This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight.

Both the participants will get the same rewards but the abilities are different depending on the fact that whether you are a winner or loser. The Ace trainer medal and its acquaintance will also get the level up with each battle that you win. The other three medals will also get a level up as per a blog post from Niantic.

The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles"></a>Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles</h2><p>To get the best out of Pokémon Go battle another trainer it is advised to get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332"                      border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?"></a>Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?</h2><p>All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.</p><p>There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.</p><p>When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068411/7443" target="_top" id="2068411"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068411"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Rare-Candy-Cheat-Fire-Red-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Rare Candy Trainer Card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get rare candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red?"></a>Part 2: How to get rare candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red?</h2><p>There are three main ways in which you can get Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red.

When you lob a Pokéball at a Pokémon, there are chances that it could escape.</p><p>What if there was a way in which you could catch a Pokémon creature every time, even Legendary Pokémon?</p><p>The Pokémon emerald master ball can do this with no effort on your part. Simply activate the ball and the Pokémon is captured. This makes the emerald Pokémon master ball a very important asset. In this article, you get to know all the Pokémon master ball cheat codes that you can use to get these valuable assets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/masterball-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="An image of a Pokémon Master Ball"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Catch Pokémon like a Pro with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

Since it is not possible to join so many servers, I would recommend considering the following options to pick some appropriate Pokemon Discord servers.</p><ol><li><strong>The Silph Road</strong></li></ol><p>The Silph Road has to be the biggest user-driven community that is dedicated to Pokemon Go out there. Apart from Pokemon spawning locations and other secrets, you can also use it to find a Pokemon Go Discord server near you.</p><p>Just go to its website to access the map of various Pokemon Go Discord servers. You can zoom in&#x2F;out the map and even move the pin around to find various servers.</p><p><em>Website:</em> <a href="https://thesilphroad.com/map#2/"><em>https://thesilphroad.com/map#2/</em></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/find-pokemon-go-discord-servers-2.jpg"                      alt="The Silph Road Discord Servers"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Discord Servers</strong></li></ol><p>As the name suggests, this is one of the biggest directories of Discord servers worldwide. Once you visit the website of Discord Servers, just enter relevant keywords on the search bar. For instance, you can enter “Pokemon Go” and simply get relevant results for Pokemon Go Discord servers. Apart from that, you can also check details about the server and know how active it is.</p><p><em>Website:</em> <a href="https://discordservers.com/search/Pokemon%20Go"><em>https://discordservers.com/search/Pokemon%20Go</em></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/find-pokemon-go-discord-servers-3.jpg"                      alt="Discord Servers Directory"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>DisBoard</strong></li></ol><p>DisBoard is another popular Discord server directory that you can consider exploring.

Though, once you have found a Discord Pokemon server, you need to obtain its invite link by clicking on the “Join” button. Afterward, you can follow these steps to join the Pokemon Go Discord server of your choice.</p><ol><li>Once you have obtained the invite link for the Pokemon Go Discord server, just go to the Discord app or the website and click on the “Add Server” option from the sidebar.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/find-pokemon-go-discord-servers-5.jpg"                      alt="Discord Add a Server"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Now, you will be given an option to either create a new server or simply join an existing server.

Evolutions mean a boost in stats and strength in raids. Plenty of Pokémon users are conversant with the traditional raiding as a way to evolve. However, you can use special items to evolve your Pokémon. One such item is the dawn stone. In this article, we are going to take you through a detailed guide on dawn stone evolutions and how to get it with ease.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon-Evolutions"><a href="#Part-1-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon-Evolutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Dawn Stone Pokémon Evolutions</h2><h3 id="What-is-Dawn-Stone-in-Pokemon-Sword-and-Shield"><a href="#What-is-Dawn-Stone-in-Pokemon-Sword-and-Shield" class="headerlink" title="What is Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield?"></a>What is Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield?</h3><p>Like Shiny Stone, dusk stone, Sun Stone, and Moon Stone, Dawn Stone is another peculiar evolution item in Pokémon Sword and Shield. If you combine Dawn Stone with certain Pokémon, they will evolve to another level. This peculiar stone was introduced in Generation IV, and in terms of appearance, Dawn Stone sparkles like a glittering eye.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/dawn-stone.jpg"                      alt="dawn stone"                ></p><p>You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.</p><h3 id="Pokemon-that-Evolve-with-Dawn-Stone"><a href="#Pokemon-that-Evolve-with-Dawn-Stone" class="headerlink" title="Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone"></a>Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone</h3><p>As aforementioned, dawn stone is an evolution item that is used to evolve certain species of Pokémon. To evolve your Pokémon using Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield, enter the bag menu and choose the “Other Items” tab. Hover on the Dawn Stone and select the “Use this item” option. Finally, select the Pokémon to evolve. These Pokémon that can be evolved using dawn stone include:</p><h3 id="1-Kirlia"><a href="#1-Kirlia" class="headerlink" title="1. Kirlia"></a>1. Kirlia</h3><p>Kirlia is a small humanoid Pokémon whose upper body and arms are white while the waist and legs are light green. This makes it appear as though it is wearing tights. Kirlia’s natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.</p><h3 id="2-Snorunt"><a href="#2-Snorunt" class="headerlink" title="2. Snorunt"></a>2. Snorunt</h3><p>Snorunt is an ice-type Pokémon that was introduced in Generation III. It is also referred to as the “Snow Hat Pokémon.” You can find Snorunt in seafoam café, snow canyon, or even in Mysterious Grotto. Furthermore, you can obtain it by trading or Pokémon Roulette. Snorunt can evolve into Glalie or Froslass. If it reaches level 42, Snorunt evolves to Glalie. For Snorunt to evolve into Froslass, it requires a dawn stone. However, the Snorunt must be a female to evolve to Froslass.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Hacks-and-Tricks-to-get-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-2-Hacks-and-Tricks-to-get-Dawn-Stone-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-1.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.</p><p>But, spoofing Pokémon Go is not easy, as Niantic keeps a close watch to spoofers. To spoof the Pogo, you will need trusted and safe spoofing apps like PGSharp for android and Dr.Fone virtual location for iOS.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-2.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Let’s find out how PGSharp and Dr.Fone virtual location app save you from getting banned while spoofing Pokémon Go.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Ninatic-Policies-against-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-1-Ninatic-Policies-against-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing"></a>Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing</h2><p>Getting banned for cheating Pokémon is nothing new. Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game. Niantic has made a proper discipline policy with three strikes to punish the spoofers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-3.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p><strong>Firstly, punishment:</strong> On the first fake strike, you will get a warning message, but you still can play the game. But, while plying, you will not be able to anything remotely for about seven days.</p><p><strong>Secondly, Punishment:</strong> On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.</p><p><strong>Thirdly, Punishment:</strong> On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.</p><p>However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pokémon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.</p><h3 id="Does-it-mean-you-can-never-spoof-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Does-it-mean-you-can-never-spoof-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?"></a>Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?</h3><p>No, you can spoof Pokémon Go with the best spoofing tools like PGSHarp and Dr.Fone virtual location.</p><p><strong>Why PGSharp?</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-4.png"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>This tool is safe and secure to use, plus it offers a real map interface, and it is difficult for Niantic to catch it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Banned-From-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Avoid-Being-Banned-From-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Avoid Being Banned From Spoofing"></a>Part 2: How to Avoid Being Banned From Spoofing</h2><p>There are tricks that help you save from the Pokémon Go ban.</p><ul><li>First, you need to use a reliable tool like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone for iOS to spoof the GPS. By doing so, Niantic can’t catch you.</li><li>Never use a modified game or third-party client to catch Pokémon. You never know the client may be a worker in the developer’s office. Therefore, you will get caught easily.</li><li>You need to be very careful about your movement in the game. If you are using a fake GPS app, then make sure your movements are reasonable. It means do not switch long-distance locations in few hours or frequently. It is because this makes it unreal in Niantic radar and may cause you a problem.</li><li>Finally, do not root your Phone, be it Android or iPhone. It is because when you root your device, its security gets compromised, and it is easy to get data about your device’s fake location. And, your Pokémon Go account also can be at risk.</li></ul><p>Therefore, in order to catch special and maximum Pokémon, you do not need to cheat the game, only PGSharp is enough. With this, you can play the game just by sitting at your home. All you need to do is install PGSharp on your device and launch it.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-makes-PGSharp-best-app-to-spoof-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-What-makes-PGSharp-best-app-to-spoof-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What makes PGSharp best app to spoof Pokémon Go"></a>Part 3: What makes PGSharp best app to spoof Pokémon Go</h2><p>The features and functions of PGSharp make it a safe spoofing app for Pokémon Go. With PGSharp, you do not need to root or jailbreak your device. It is a safe and secure app for android users specially designed to spoof Pokémon Go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-5.jpg"                      alt="drfone"                ></p><p>Now since you have PGSharp installed, you need to enable developer options on Android. For this, go to Settings &gt; About Phone&gt;build number.</p><p>Tap seven times on the build number to enable the developer options.

A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade.

Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”</strong></em></p><p>If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu"><a href="#Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu"></a>Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu</h2><h3 id="What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features"><a href="#What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features" class="headerlink" title="What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?"></a>What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?</h3><p>Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.</p><p>It’s an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.</p><p>You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible. Now, let’s look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Where-to-catch-Pachirisu"><a href="#Where-to-catch-Pachirisu" class="headerlink" title="Where to catch Pachirisu?"></a>Where to catch Pachirisu?</h3><p>As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.</p><h3 id="Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates"><a href="#Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates" class="headerlink" title="Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?"></a>Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?</h3><p>As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.</p><p>As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.</p><p>To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You"><a href="#Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You"></a>Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You</h2><p>Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it.

You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.</p><p>Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn’t just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.</p><p>Once you defeat Team Go Rocket’s second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn’t be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.</p><p>Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pokémon.</li><li><strong>Trade with other players.</strong> If you have friends who also play Pokémon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pokémon with them. Just make sure you’re in a specific range with them.</li><li><strong>Use incense and lures.</strong> Both of these will help you attract more Pokémon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.</li><li><strong>Play on the Community Days.</strong> If you’re looking to catch a Shiny Pokémon, don’t forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!</li><li><strong>Have friends in other regions.</strong> You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pokémon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pokémon with each other.</li><li><strong>Use a virtual GPS at home.</strong> If you don’t have anyone to trade your regional Pokémon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pokémon!</li></ul><p>Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pokémon. Are you ready to complete your Pokedex faster?</p><h3 id="What-is-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location"><a href="#What-is-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="What is Dr.Fone – Virtual Location"></a>What is Dr.Fone – Virtual Location</h3><p>Dr.Fone Virtual Location is a super useful software when it comes to spoofing the locations of your device.

On top of that, the software is super easy to use, so you don’t need to be tech-savvy to use it. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can easily access region-exclusive Pokémon.

The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install:</strong></p><p>Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect:</strong></p><p>Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:</strong></p><p>Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.</p><p>To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the ‘March’ button. You will be required to do the Pokémon Go walking illusion at some point. Dr. Fone’s virtual movement imitation application eases your life and lets you do the job without being concerned about travel costs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="virtual location 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-Shiny-Meltan-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-Shiny-Meltan-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pokémon Go?</h2><p>Meltan is a legendary steel-type Pokémon that was initially launched in Pokémon Go. It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Let’s Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.</p><p>The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-home-vs-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon home vs pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokémon is one of the most enjoyable games, not only because it yields prizes such as the mystery box Pokémon, Meltan Pokémon, shiny Meltan Pokémon go, but it also develops players’ interest completely.

Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick. While Pokemon joysticks are extremely popular, they have some downfalls as well if you don’t pick the right tool. Therefore, in this post, I will list the risks and benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick hack to help you make up your mind.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know"><a href="#Part-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-101-Things-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know"></a><strong>Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know</strong></h2><p>Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack. Ideally, Pokemon Go joysticks are dedicated mobile or desktop applications that let us simulate the movement of our device. In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.</p><ul><li>Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.</li><li>They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.</li><li>The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398457/3022" target="_top" id="398457"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398457"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="980" height="120"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398457/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick"                ></p><p>Therefore, with the help of a Pokemon Go hack APK like this, players don’t have to leave their house to catch Pokemons. They can also participate in raids to hatch eggs from the comfort of their home.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Benefits-of-Playing-Pokemon-Go-with-a-Joystick" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?"></a><strong>Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?</strong></h2><p>There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS&#x2F;Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:</p><ul><li><p>Stay Safe Indoors</p><p>  Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.</p></li><li><p>Move Beyond your Area</p><p>  If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.</p></li><li><p>Catch More Pokemons</p><p>  One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!</p></li><li><p>Level-up in the Game Easily</p><p>  From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.</p></li><li><p>Have a Better Gaming Experience</p><p>  Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.</p></li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks"><a href="#Part-3-What-are-the-Risks-of-Using-Pokemon-Go-Joysticks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?"></a><strong>Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?</strong></h2><p>While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.</p><ul><li><p>Account Ban by Niantic</p><p>  Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p><p>  To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration"                ></p></li><li><p>Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices</p><p>  To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.</p></li><li><p>The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down</p><p>  Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.</p></li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs.

This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature</strong></p><p>At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg"                      alt="enable developer options"                ></p><p>Great!

Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://engwe.pxf.io/c/5597632/2093504/25579" target="_top" id="2093504"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/25579-2093504"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2093504/25579"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg"                      alt="fake gps lexa"                ></p><p>Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg"                      alt="select mock location app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Change your device’s location</strong></p><p>That’s it!

This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1"                ></p><p>The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.</p><p>Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer"></a>Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2"                ></p><p>It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity.

If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iOS-App-Store-pic-3"                ></p><h3 id="In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs"><a href="#In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs" class="headerlink" title="In-built spoofing with VPNs"></a>In-built spoofing with VPNs</h3><p>Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.</p><p>The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4"                ></p><p>If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone.

To succeed, players are encouraged to create teams of their Pokemons that they have to use to complete missions. Though, it might take a while to master how you create a winning team. To help you, I have come up with some smart tips that would let you come up with some amazing Pokemon teams.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Team Building Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Some-Good-Pokemon-Team-Examples"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Some-Good-Pokemon-Team-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Some Good Pokemon Team Examples?"></a>Part 1: What are Some Good Pokemon Team Examples?</h2><p>To understand the dynamics of team composition, you should know that there are ideally different kinds of Pokemons:</p><ul><li>Sweeper: These Pokemons are mostly used to attack as they can do a lot of damage and even move swiftly. Though, they have low defense stats and can be of a physical or special type.</li><li>Tanker: These Pokemons have high defense stats and can take a lot of damage. Though, they have slow movement and low attacking stats.</li><li>Annoyer: They are known for their fast movement and while their damage might not be so high, they can annoy your opponents.</li><li>Cleric: These are supportive Pokemons that are mostly used to heal or boost the stats of other Pokemons.</li><li>Drainer: These are also supportive Pokemons, but they can drain the stats of your opponents while healing your team.</li><li>Wall: These are tougher than tank Pokemons and can take a substantial amount of damage from sweepers.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-4.jpg"                      alt="hola free vpn"                ></p><p>Based on these different types of Pokemons, you can come up with the following teams to win your next battle:</p><h3 id="1-2x-Physical-Sweeper-2x-Special-Sweeper-Tanker-and-Annoyer"><a href="#1-2x-Physical-Sweeper-2x-Special-Sweeper-Tanker-and-Annoyer" class="headerlink" title="1. 2x Physical Sweeper, 2x Special Sweeper, Tanker, and Annoyer"></a>1. 2x Physical Sweeper, 2x Special Sweeper, Tanker, and Annoyer</h3><p>If you want to have an attacking team, then this would be the perfect combination. While the annoyer and tanker would drain the HP of the opponents, your sweeper Pokemons can finish them with their high attacking stats.</p><h3 id="2-3x-Sweepers-Physical-Special-Mixed-Tanker-Wall-and-Annoyer"><a href="#2-3x-Sweepers-Physical-Special-Mixed-Tanker-Wall-and-Annoyer" class="headerlink" title="2. 3x Sweepers (Physical&#x2F;Special&#x2F;Mixed), Tanker, Wall, and Annoyer"></a>2. 3x Sweepers (Physical&#x2F;Special&#x2F;Mixed), Tanker, Wall, and Annoyer</h3><p>This is one of the most balanced Pokemon teams that would work in almost every situation. In this, we have a tanker and a wall to take damage from the opponent’s Pokemon.

Drainer, Tanker, Cleric, and 3 Sweepers (Physical&#x2F;Special&#x2F;Mixed)</h3><p>In some situations (when there are lots of sweepers in the opponent’s team), this team would excel. Your support Pokemons (drainers and clerics) would boost the HP of sweepers while the tanker would take the damage.</p><h3 id="4-Rayquaza-Arceus-Dialga-Kyogre-Palkia-and-Groudon"><a href="#4-Rayquaza-Arceus-Dialga-Kyogre-Palkia-and-Groudon" class="headerlink" title="4.

This is useful for games like Pokemon Go, where you can catch Pokemons from different regions without leaving your home. However, iSpoofer is not available for download anymore. If you are looking for an alternative to iSpoofer, you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location. Here’s how you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location to spoof your location on your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+.</p><p><a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png"                      alt="avatar"                ></a></p><p>iSpoofer is one of the most useful tools for iOS users, that’s designed to simulate a user’s GPS location. With iSpoofer, you can change your current location to anywhere in the world and access geo-restricted content without any hassle. While the tool has several real-world applications, the majority of users use iSpoofer to fake their location to catch rare Pokemon in Pokemon Go.</p><p>Since iSpoofer is an extremely reliable app, even Android users want to know if they can use it on their smartphones or not. If you’re one of them, this guide will help. In today’s article, we are going to discuss if you can download <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong> or not and what are some of the best solutions to fake GPS location on an Android device.</p><p>So, without any further ado, let’s get started.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part1" >Part 1: Can I download the iSpoofer on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part2" >Part 2: Common ways to spoof on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-download-the-iSpoofer-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-download-the-iSpoofer-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1:  Can I download the iSpoofer on Android"></a><strong><strong>Part 1:  Can I download the iSpoofer on Android</strong></strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, iSpoofer isn’t available for Android. It’s an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won’t be able to download <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong> at all.</p><p>However, the good news is that you don’t need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that’ll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you’ll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Common-ways-to-spoof-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Common-ways-to-spoof-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android"></a><strong><strong>Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android</strong></strong></h2><p>When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you’ll have to be extra cautious. <em>Why?</em> Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren’t reliable and may damage your smartphone’s overall functionality as well.</p><p>Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.</p><ol><li><strong>Use VMOS</strong></li></ol><p>VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you’ll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you’ll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg"                      alt="vmos"                ></p><p>The only downside of using VMOS is that it’s extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you’ll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn’t have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Root Your Device</strong></li></ol><p>Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you’ll root your device, you won’t be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don’t want to void your smartphone’s warranty, ‘rooting’ may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Use PGSharp</strong></li></ol><p>PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong>. It’s a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick. The best part about using PGSharp is that it’s compatible with all Android devices. You won’t have to root your device to install and run PGSharp.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp"                ></p><p>You can either choose the free or the paid version of the app. Of course, the latter comes with a few additional features, but if you only want to fake location in Pokemon Go, the free version of PGSharp will get the job done as well.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that PGSharp isn’t available on Google Play Store and you’ll have to download it from the official <a href="https://www.pgsharp.com/"><u>PGSharp website</u></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087264/19272" target="_top" id="2087264"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087264"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2087264/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Extension-safest-way-to-spoof-on-iOS-Dr-Fone-virtual-location"><a href="#Extension-safest-way-to-spoof-on-iOS-Dr-Fone-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location"></a><strong>Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location</strong></h2><p>So, that’s how you can fake GPS location on an Android device and collect different types of Pokemon in Pokemon Go. Even though iSPoofer isn’t available for Android, you can still use the above three methods to mock location without any effort.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that iSpoofer is permanently shut down and you can no longer install it on iOS devices as well. Even the iSpoofer website is down and if you want to fake location on your iPhone&#x2F;iPad, you’ll have to look for other options. One of the best ways to change GPS location on an iOS device is to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). It’s a professional geo spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a wide variety of features to mock location on Tecno Spark 20 Pro+s.</p><p>It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that’ll allow you to change your current location to anywhere in the world. You can even set a fake location using its GPS coordinates. Like iSpoofer, <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</u></a> also comes with the GPS Joystick feature. This means you’ll be able to catch different types of Pokemon without moving at all.</p><p>Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).</p><ul><li>Change your current location with a single click</li><li>Use GPS coordinates to find locations</li><li>Virtually control your GPS movement using the Joystick feature</li><li>Customize your movement speed while walking in different directions</li><li>Compatible with all iOS versions</li></ul><p>Follow these steps to change your GPS location on an iDevice using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Step 1 - Install the Dr.Fone toolkit on your computer and launch the software. Click “Virtual Location” and connect your iPhone to the computer using a lightning cable.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 2 - Once the tool recognizes your device, click “Get Started” to proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch the Virtual Location"                ></p><p>Step 3 - You’ll be prompted to a map that’ll point to your current location. Select “Teleport Mode” from the top-right corner and use the search bar to find the desired location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Step 4 - The pointer will move to the selected location automatically.

By playing Pokemon Go with your friends, you can create teams, participate in raids, and do so much more. Though, the best way to make new friends in the game is by joining an active Pokemon Go Discord server. The good news is that Discord has tons of international and local Pokemon Go servers that you can join. Find out how to find the most appropriate Pokemon Go Discord servers in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/find-pokemon-go-discord-servers-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Discord Servers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Where-can-I-find-the-Best-Pokemon-Go-Discord-Servers"><a href="#Part-1-Where-can-I-find-the-Best-Pokemon-Go-Discord-Servers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Where can I find the Best Pokemon Go Discord Servers?"></a><strong>Part 1: Where can I find the Best Pokemon Go Discord Servers?</strong></h2><p>Ideally, there are hundreds of Discord servers dedicated to Pokemon Go that you can find. Since it is not possible to join so many servers, I would recommend considering the following options to pick some appropriate Pokemon Discord servers.</p><ol><li><strong>The Silph Road</strong></li></ol><p>The Silph Road has to be the biggest user-driven community that is dedicated to Pokemon Go out there. Apart from Pokemon spawning locations and other secrets, you can also use it to find a Pokemon Go Discord server near you.</p><p>Just go to its website to access the map of various Pokemon Go Discord servers.

The good news is that the Pokémon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pokémon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.</p><p>What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-does-Soft-Banned-Cooldown-Mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-does-Soft-Banned-Cooldown-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What does Soft Banned &amp; Cooldown Mean?"></a>Part 1: What does Soft Banned &amp; Cooldown Mean?</h2><p>A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pokémon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you’re soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.</p><p>What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?"></a>Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?</h2><p>When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?</h2><h3 id="1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down"><a href="#1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down" class="headerlink" title="1. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?"></a>1. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?</h3><p>The cooldown time is proportional to the distance covered by the player. So, when you perform an action marking our location, the cooldown time starts, and you must wait until the cooldown time is over. Here is a quick review of how long the cooldown you can expect.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Total Distance Covered</strong></th><th><strong>Cooldown Period</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 km</td><td>30 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>5 km</td><td>2 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>10 km</td><td>6 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>25 km</td><td>11 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>30 km</td><td>14 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>65 km</td><td>22 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>81 km</td><td>25 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>100 km</td><td>35 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>250 km</td><td>45 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>500 km</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>750 km</td><td>1 hour 20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>1000 km</td><td>1 hour 30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;1500 km</td><td>2 hour</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="2-How-long-must-I-wait-to-avoid-a-softban"><a href="#2-How-long-must-I-wait-to-avoid-a-softban" class="headerlink" title="2.

Actions that Do trigger cooldown?</h3><p>The main reasons for a soft ban are GPS spoofing, changing your location to a distant place in a short time, and traveling too fast to combat playing while driving. Sharing accounts is another reason.</p><p>So, what action of a player can trigger a cooldown? Let us list them here for quick reference.</p><ul><li>If you catch a wild Pokémon, like the ones coming from Incense, Meltan’s Mystery Box،, Lure Modules, and Special Lures.</li><li>Another trigger of the cooldown is dropping the ball on the encounter screen.</li><li>When you feed a wild Pokémon a berry.</li><li>When you feed a gym defender on a screen radar.</li><li>Gym battles.</li><li>When a Pokémon flees, if you try to catch it.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Actions-that-DO-NOT-trigger-cooldown"><a href="#4-Actions-that-DO-NOT-trigger-cooldown" class="headerlink" title="4.

Players get to be a part of the various regions of the Pokemon has now become one with our world. The game requires you to travel to different locations to complete researches, catch Pokemon, defend gyms, and most importantly, complete the Pokedex given by Professor Willow. Niantic’s games are designed to be played with others outdoors. This feature ends up giving players in some parts of the world advantage over others. This is specially to catch regional Pokemon and during ticketed events and sponsored events. Spoofers can avoid the barriers of distance and play anywhere in the world by iSpoofer for pogo installation and other such apps. Niantic, however, does not allow this and considers it the same as hacking. Players who were looking to play and access all the features of the game available all across the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-the-iSpoofer-back-on-2020"><a href="#Part-1-Will-the-iSpoofer-back-on-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?"></a>Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?</h2><p>iSpoofer has been shut down. All its applications, websites, and other related services have been terminated. iSpoofer for pogo installation does not exist. If any website claims to give access to the application or iSpoofer direct download, it is fake. Also, the new Pokemon Go application version which is 0.195.0 has been updated to detect applications like iSpoofer, so on being detected, it may lead to a warning, or a permanent ban as well. And we don’t see the certainty to get it back soon.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-guide-of-iSpoofer-for-pogo-installation"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-guide-of-iSpoofer-for-pogo-installation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation"></a>Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation</h2><p>This detailed guide for iSpoofer installation is for those who still possess the older version of the app that works in an older iOS version.</p><p><strong>Step 1 –</strong> Install the setup for iSpoofer on your computer if you had got it using. This requires the latest version of iTunes, so make sure that you have it installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/install-ispoofer-setup.jpg"                      alt="install ispoofer setup"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 –</strong> Once the setup is done, connect your phone to the computer and unlock it. You will have to select the “TRUST” option for the software to do its work. On selecting this option, iSpoofer will download a developer file that will spoof the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/unlock-and-trust-software.jpg"                      alt="unlock and trust software"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 –</strong> A map will load on your computer screen, which allows you to enter or point the location. Enter the location of your choice and click on “MOVE”. And that is it! Three simple steps and you have spoofed!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-your-phone-location.jpg"                      alt="change your phone location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-the-iSpoofer-when-you-play-pokemon"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-the-iSpoofer-when-you-play-pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to use the iSpoofer when you play pokemon"></a>Part 3: How to use the iSpoofer when you play pokemon</h2><p>Follow the tutorial above for ispoofer for pogo installation. A mock location has now been added to your device that makes iOS believe that you are at the entered spot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-ispoofer-view.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go ispoofer view"                ></p><p>Following these steps, disconnect your phone and launch Pokemon Go. From here you can either use the joystick to move around or use a “.gpx” file to add a preset route for you to move around. That would look like this -</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/gpx-file-for-preset-route.jpg"                      alt="gpx file for preset route"                ></p><p>iSpoofer for pogo installation has the following disadvantages -</p><ul><li>The application cannot work without iTunes and is very dependent on it.</li><li>Niantic can easily detect spoofing through this app and may lead to a ban.</li><li>Movement simulations are hard and unnatural, making it more susceptible to a ban.</li><li>Configurations and settings require some technical knowledge in to troubleshoot any errors.</li><li>The app is prone to crashing a lot. The interface sometimes cannot handle the constant change of locations.</li></ul><p>All these issues are overcome with great detail by Dr. Fone Virtual Location (iOS) by Wondershare.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Safer-tool-to-spoof-pokemon-drfone-virtual-location"><a href="#Part-4-Safer-tool-to-spoof-pokemon-drfone-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Safer tool to spoof pokemon- drfone virtual location"></a>Part 4: Safer tool to spoof pokemon- drfone virtual location</h2><p>Pokemon Go Spoofers using iOS need not depend on iSpoofer for jumping locations. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare is the new, safer app to spoof in Pokemon Go.

It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.</p><p>It’s an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.</p><p>You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible.

Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.</p><h3 id="Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates"><a href="#Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates" class="headerlink" title="Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?"></a>Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?</h3><p>As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.</p><p>As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.</p><p>To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You"><a href="#Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You"></a>Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You</h2><p>Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it.

It needs so much walking, and I can’t do that because of my work – as I don’t get too much time to go out. I know so many people who use location spoofers to do it. Can someone tell me <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong>?”</em></p><p>If you are also going through a similar situation with Pokemon Go, then this would be a perfect guide for you. Ideally, to hatch an egg in Pokemon Go, users are supposed to walk a lot. Don’t worry – some smart tricks can help you hatch more eggs without walking. Read on and learn how to hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-1.jpg"                      alt="hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go"                ></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u8SwzCXW-tc"></iframe><p> <em>Click “Try It Free” to Download Dr.Fone and Hatch Eggs in Pokemon Go Without Walking Now!</em></p><h2 id="Way-1-Use-an-iOS-Location-Spoofer"><a href="#Way-1-Use-an-iOS-Location-Spoofer" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Use an iOS Location Spoofer"></a>Way 1: Use an iOS Location Spoofer</h2><p>An iOS location spoofer is one of the best ways to learn Pokemon Go hatch eggs without walking. If you own an iOS device, then I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which provides excellent location spoofing solutions. With just one click, you can mock your location to anywhere else in the world. Furthermore, you can also simulate your movement between different spots.</p><ul><li>There is a dedicated feature to simulate our walking movement from one spot to another or between multiple spots using it.</li><li>You can enter the number of times you wish to move to and from the specific locations on Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS).</li><li>There is also an option to select your speed – which can make you mock movements like walking, cycling, or driving.</li><li>You can change your locations and movements as many times as you want without the need to jailbreak your device.</li></ul><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo"></iframe><p>To learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), the following steps can be taken.</p><p><strong><em>Step 1: Connect your device and launch the app</em></strong></p><p>Firstly, just connect your iPhone to the application and launch the Wondershare Dr.Fone &gt; Virtual Location feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Dr.Fone"                ></p><p>Just agree to the terms and click on the “Get Started” button to launch the interface of Virtual Location and start Pokemon Go how to hatch eggs at home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><em>Step 2: Walk between two stops</em></strong></p><p>As the interface would be launched, you can see five different modes in the top-right corner. Just click on the third option (One-stop route) and look for any location from the search bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="walk mode"                ></p><p>Now you can just select the number of times you wish to move and complete other settings, such as enabling the realistic and fluctuation mode.

If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times.

Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it!

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ service on your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts.

You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg.

All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected.

A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg"                      alt="catch 100 iv pokemon"                ></p><ul><li>If you are fortunate, then you can end up <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >catching a “lucky” Pokémon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.</li><li>Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.</li><li>Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).</li><li>Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.</li></ul><p>Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg"                      alt="trading increases the chance of perfect ivs"                ></p><ul><li>For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375</li><li>With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744</li><li>When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197</li><li>Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331</li></ul><p>But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful.

So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pokémon.</li><li><strong>Trade with other players.</strong> If you have friends who also play Pokémon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pokémon with them. Just make sure you’re in a specific range with them.</li><li><strong>Use incense and lures.</strong> Both of these will help you attract more Pokémon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.</li><li><strong>Play on the Community Days.</strong> If you’re looking to catch a Shiny Pokémon, don’t forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!</li><li><strong>Have friends in other regions.</strong> You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pokémon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pokémon with each other.</li><li><strong>Use a virtual GPS at home.</strong> If you don’t have anyone to trade your regional Pokémon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pokémon!</li></ul><p>Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pokémon. Are you ready to complete your Pokedex faster?</p><h3 id="What-is-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location"><a href="#What-is-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="What is Dr.Fone – Virtual Location"></a>What is Dr.Fone – Virtual Location</h3><p>Dr.Fone Virtual Location is a super useful software when it comes to spoofing the locations of your device.

Fixed"></a>Why is iPogo not working On Tecno Spark 20 Pro+? Fixed</h2><p>The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working"><a href="#Part-1-Common-problem-that-iPogo-is-not-working" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working"></a>Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working</h2><p>Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><h3 id="Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue"><a href="#Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue"></a>Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue</h3><p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Install the Official Version:</strong> It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.</li></ul><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location"><a href="#Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location"></a>Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location</h2><p>If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use. You can employ a much simpler and easier to install GPS mocking application like Wondershare’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Be sure to take pre-emptive measures suggested in this article and you would notice your device running smoothly in no time.</p><h2 id="How-Can-I-Catch-the-Regional-Pokemon-without-Traveling-On-Tecno-Spark-20-Pro"><a href="#How-Can-I-Catch-the-Regional-Pokemon-without-Traveling-On-Tecno-Spark-20-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Tecno Spark 20 Pro+"></a>How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Tecno Spark 20 Pro+</h2><p>The main goal that the designers of Pokémon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pokémon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced"><a href="#Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced"></a>Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced</h2><p>Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.</p><p>These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.</p><p>There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.</p><p>If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.</p><p>List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!</p><p>As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.</p><h3 id="Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon"></a>Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/kanto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="kanto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Taouros:</strong> North America.</li><li><strong>Farfetch’d:</strong> Asia.</li><li><strong>Mr. Mime:</strong> Europe.</li><li><strong>Kangashkhan:</strong> Australia&#x2F;Pacific.</li></ul><h3 id="Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon"></a>Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/johto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="johto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Heracross:</strong> South America&#x2F; Southern Florida.</li><li><strong>Corsola:</strong> Equatorial Latitudes.</li></ul><h3 id="Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon"></a>Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/hoenn-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="hoenn pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Tropius:</strong> The Middle East and Africa.</li><li><strong>Torkoal:</strong> Southeast Asia.</li><li><strong>Volbeat:</strong> Europe, Australia, and Asia.</li><li><strong>Relicanth:</strong> The Cook Islands&#x2F;New Zealand.</li><li><strong>Solrock:</strong> Currently America and Africa.

You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you’re traveling around the world.

If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.</p><ul><li><strong>Curve Ball:</strong> Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.</li><li><strong>Maximize your Medals:</strong> Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.</li><li><strong>Keep Consistent:</strong> The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.</li><li><strong>Save your Berries:</strong> Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.</li><li><strong>Use Powerful Poke balls:</strong> Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="1080" height="1620" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:1080px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Tecno Spark 20 Pro+<p><em><strong>“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore?

Shiny Stone was introduced in Generation IV and is no different from other evolution stones such as dusk stones, dawn stone, and ice stone, to mention but a few. The major differences could be their location as well as the type of Pokémon they help to evolve. You can identify this peculiar stone by its dazzling, shining light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shiny-stone-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="shiny stone Pokémon"                ></p><h3 id="How-and-where-to-find-a-Shiny-Stone-evolution"><a href="#How-and-where-to-find-a-Shiny-Stone-evolution" class="headerlink" title="How and where to find a Shiny Stone evolution"></a>How and where to find a Shiny Stone evolution</h3><p>In Pokémon Sword and Shield, the easiest way to get any evolution stone, including Shiny Stone, is by completing poke jobs.

If it performs great, you will be rewarded with an evolution stone that could be a Shiny Stone. If you want your Pokémon to do a great job, make sure you meticulously read through the summary of every given poke job.

Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”</strong></em></p><p>If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu"><a href="#Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu"></a>Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu</h2><h3 id="What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features"><a href="#What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features" class="headerlink" title="What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?"></a>What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?</h3><p>Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.</p><p>It’s an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.</p><p>You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible.

Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.</p><h3 id="Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates"><a href="#Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates" class="headerlink" title="Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?"></a>Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?</h3><p>As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.</p><p>As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.</p><p>To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You"><a href="#Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You"></a>Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You</h2><p>Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it.

To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.</p><p>With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool</strong></p><p>To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your iPhone to it.

Evolving your Pokémon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.</p><p>Now, while some of your Pokémon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pokémon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive – one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.</p><p><strong>Pokémon Go Sun Stone evolutions</strong> can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Sun-Stones-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You’ll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pokémon. Depending on the species, you’ll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don’t worry, evolutions don’t affect the total number of Pokémon in your collection).</p><p>Depending on the specific Pokémon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).</p><p>You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1997795">                    <video width="250" height="250" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1997795">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1997795.jpeg"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:250px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fproteahair.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1997795%2F23621'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1997795/23621"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 3.

Only the lucky few are able to come across it randomly, as it comes with a mere 1% drop chance.</p><p>Fortunately, for all those unlucky ones, you can acquire the Sun Stone to complete your Pokémon evolutions in a few different ways.</p><h3 id="Special-Events"><a href="#Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="Special Events"></a>Special Events</h3><p>Partaking in Pokémon Go special events is almost always a lucrative experience. You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pokémon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:</p><ul><li>Lunar New Year – February 5 to February 11;</li><li>Carnival of Love – February 13 to February 15;</li><li>Road to Sinnoh – February 19 to February 23.</li></ul><p>You’ll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a Sun Stone, there’s always a possibility!</p><h3 id="Field-Research"><a href="#Field-Research" class="headerlink" title="Field Research"></a>Field Research</h3><p>Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pokémon, so he’ll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.</p><p>As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.</p><h3 id="Special-Research"><a href="#Special-Research" class="headerlink" title="Special Research"></a>Special Research</h3><p>With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.</p><p>Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.</p><p>As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.</p><h3 id="Gyms-and-PokeStops"><a href="#Gyms-and-PokeStops" class="headerlink" title="Gyms and PokeStops"></a>Gyms and PokeStops</h3><p>Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.</p><p>While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.</p><p>Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Gather-Sun-Stones-Efficiently" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.</p><p>You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.</p><p>To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:</p><ol><li>Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;</li><li>Connect your phone to your computer;</li><li>Go to <strong>Toolbox &gt; Virtual Location &gt; Get Started</strong>;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="get started with wondershare dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>On the map that shows up, click on <strong>No Device</strong>in the upper right-hand corner;</li><li>You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png"                      alt="choose the Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ device you want to connect to dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>On your phone, tap <strong>Allow USB Debugging</strong>;</li><li>On your phone, go to <strong>Developer Options&gt; Select mock location app</strong>;</li><li>Select <strong>Fone</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png"                      alt="set up mock location on your phone"                ></p><p>From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement.
