    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Where-Is-the-Best-Place-to-Catch-Dratini-On-Realme-Narzo-60-5G"><a href="#Where-Is-the-Best-Place-to-Catch-Dratini-On-Realme-Narzo-60-5G" class="headerlink" title="Where Is the Best Place to Catch Dratini On Realme Narzo 60 5G"></a>Where Is the Best Place to Catch Dratini On Realme Narzo 60 5G</h2><p>Dratini is a rare Pokemon that can be found in the wild. It is a Dragon-type Pokemon that evolves into Dragonair and then into Dragonite. Dratini is a popular Pokemon among players due to its rarity and powerful evolution. If you are looking to catch Dratini on your Realme Narzo 60 5G, you may be wondering where the best place to find them is.</p><p>Dratini is one of the Pokémon creatures that resemble a snake. It has an elongated blue body with a blue white underside. It carries three-pronged fins on each side of its head which are white in color. Dratini also has a white bump on the forehead.</p><p>Dratini has an energy level that is constantly increasing, which makes it grow and can reach a length of more than 6 feet. It sheds its skin every time it has to grow, and usually hide behind a waterfall when shedding. The colony of Dratini lives underwater, living at the bottom feeding on food that falls from the upper levels. Outrage is the signature move for this Pokémon creature.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-evolution-of-Dratini"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-evolution-of-Dratini" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the evolution of Dratini?"></a>Part 1: What’s the evolution of Dratini?</h2><p>Dratini undergoes two different evolutions</p><p>The first un-evolved version is the serpentine Dratini that looks like a snake and continues shedding its skin as it grows. When you get to level 30, Dratini evolves into Dragonair, and at level 55 it becomes Dragonite</p><h3 id="Dragonair"><a href="#Dragonair" class="headerlink" title="Dragonair"></a>Dragonair</h3><p>This is an evolution of Dratini, which has a long scaly serpent-like body. It still retails the blue body with a white underside. The white bump on the forehead now becomes a white horn. The budding wings on the side of the head have now grown into full wings. It also carries three crystal orbs, with one on the neck and the other two on the tail.</p><p>Dragonair has the ability to stretch its wings so it can fly. It has a huge amount of energy in the body and can discharge the energy through the crystals. The energy that it releases has the ability to change the weather wherever it is. Dragonair can be found in seas and lakes.</p><h3 id="Dragonite"><a href="#Dragonite" class="headerlink" title="Dragonite"></a>Dragonite</h3><p>This is a Pokémon character that truly resembles a dragon and is the second evolution of Dratini. It has a yellow thick body, and a couple of antennae that come out of its forehead. It has a striated underbelly. The body is quite large when compared to the small wings.</p><p>Dragonite can fly at very high speeds despite its bulky appearance. It is a kindhearted Pokémon, which is as intelligent as a human being. It has been found to have tendencies to save humans from disasters, such as saving those who have come from a capsized ship on the high seas. It lives near the sea and is extremely rare in the Pokémon world.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Where-can-I-find-the-Dratini-nest"><a href="#Part-2-Where-can-I-find-the-Dratini-nest" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Where can I find the Dratini nest?"></a>Part 2: Where can I find the Dratini nest?</h2><p>Dratini is a Pokémon that lives in the water. Since it loves lakes and seas, you can find it when you visit areas that are near water. For example, in the United States, the most famous nests for Dratini are found in North Eastern San Francisco, Pier 39 and Pier 15. You will always find Dratini at these sites and they are famous for people who want to farm Dratini.</p><p>You may also g West to Squirtle Nest where you can get a lot of Dratini.</p><p>Dratini has a 5% spawning chance every day, so if you have the time, you can spend it on these sites as you enjoy the watery view and wait for it to appear.</p><p>Dratini nests can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Tokyo, Japan; Sydney and New South Wales, Australia; Paris, France and others.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Are-the-Dratini-nest-and-spawn-spot-in-the-same-place"><a href="#Part-3-Are-the-Dratini-nest-and-spawn-spot-in-the-same-place" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Are the Dratini nest and spawn spot in the same place?"></a>Part 3: Are the Dratini nest and spawn spot in the same place?</h2><p>This is quite a common question for those who are new to the Pokémon universe. Basically, Dratini nests and spawn points are the same for a period of two weeks. The nests then migrate leaving the spawn points to spawn different types of Pokémon.</p><p>If the Dratini nest migrates, it can still come back in the future. You should always keep an eye at the spawn point where you first encountered your first Dratini Nest; it may come back once more and you can continue farming Dratini.</p><p>Dratini nests will migrate on alternate Thursdays at midnight. The nest migrations are random, so make sure that you visit and hit them many times over the two weeks in order to get the most Dratini that you can.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-increase-the-possibility-of-earning-Pokemon-Go-Dratini"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-increase-the-possibility-of-earning-Pokemon-Go-Dratini" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?"></a>Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Dratini can be found in certain places around the world. If you live outside these regions, you cannot be able to get Dratini. The best way to go about getting Dratini in such cases is to virtually relocate your device. This means that you can take your device to Tokyo nest sites even if you live in Africa.</p><p>The best app to use for teleportation is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</strong></p><ul><li>Instantly teleport to an area where a Dratini nest has been found and remotely collect as many as you can.</li><li>Use the joystick feature to move around the map until you come across Dratini.</li><li>The app allows you to seem to be walking, riding a bike, or in a vehicle, on the map. This simulates real-time travel data, which is important when playing Pokémon Go.</li><li>Any app that relies on geo-location data can safely use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for teleportation.</li></ul><p><strong>A step-by-step guide to spoof your location using Dr.Fone Virtual Location (iOS)</strong></p><p>On the official Dr.Fone page, download and install Dr.Fone on your computer or you can click the Download button below to download it directly. Launch it and then go to the Home screen and click on “Virtual Location”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p>After entering the virtual location module, connect your iOS device to your computer using an original USB cable.</p><p>Next, click on “Get Started”; you will now be able to start the spoofing process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 01"                ></p><p>Looking at the map, you can now see the actual location of your device. If the coordinates are not the correct ones, go to the bottom of your computer screen and click on the “Current Virtual location” icon. This will instantly point to the current virtual location of your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="virtual location 03"                ></p><p>Now go to the top side of your computer screen and click on the third icon on the bar.

You can use the joystick feature for this. You should also click on “Move here” so your location is permanently moved to that place.</p><p>You may now camp and keep hitting the Dratini nest so you can farm as many as possible within the two weeks before the nest migrates to another location.</p><p>Camping and looking for other Pokémon in the area will help you cool down and therefore avoid being banned from the game for spoofing your iOS device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 05"                ></p><p>This is how your location will be viewed on the map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-06.png"                      alt="virtual location 06"                ></p><p>This is how your location will be viewed on another iPhone device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png"                      alt="virtual location 07"                ></p><h2 id="In-conclusion"><a href="#In-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In conclusion"></a>In conclusion</h2><p>Dratini is one of the most friendly but rare Pokémon to get.

So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pokémon.</li><li><strong>Trade with other players.</strong> If you have friends who also play Pokémon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pokémon with them. Just make sure you’re in a specific range with them.</li><li><strong>Use incense and lures.</strong> Both of these will help you attract more Pokémon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.</li><li><strong>Play on the Community Days.</strong> If you’re looking to catch a Shiny Pokémon, don’t forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!</li><li><strong>Have friends in other regions.</strong> You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pokémon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pokémon with each other.</li><li><strong>Use a virtual GPS at home.</strong> If you don’t have anyone to trade your regional Pokémon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pokémon!</li></ul><p>Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice.

So, without any further delay, let’s get started.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Who-is-Mega-greninja"><a href="#Part-1-Who-is-Mega-greninja" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Who is Mega greninja?"></a>Part 1: Who is Mega greninja?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mega-greninja-pokemon-pic-1.png"                      alt="Mega greninja pokemon"                ></p><p>Also, called the Ninja Pokemon, Greninja is Dark&#x2F; Water-type pokemon. Some people love to call it a frog-like master. One of the most amazing features of Greninja pokemon is that with its swift movements, you will notice that this pokemon succeeds in confusing its opponents.</p><p>It makes use of very sharp throwing stars to slice its enemies. It features Torrent ability.</p><p>There are various weaknesses of this pokemon which include “Fighting”, “Grass”, “Electric”, “Bug”, and “Fairy”.Its worth mentioning here that Greninja pokemon is the final evolution of Froakie.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Strengths-of-Greninja-in-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Strengths-of-Greninja-in-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Strengths of Greninja in Pokemon?"></a>Part 2: What are the Strengths of Greninja in Pokemon?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/strength-mega-Greninja-Pokemon-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="strength mega Greninja Pokemon"                ></p><p>Greninja is resistant to “Water”, “Fire”, “Ice”, “Dark”, “Steel” and finally “Ghost”. Also, this pokemon is immune to “Psychic”. This pokemon’s presence can be very intimidating for its opponents, it would not be wrong if we say that Greninja is quite unpredictable.

It’s important to ensure that when you are setting up Dr.Fone on your device, always ensure that your iPhone is connected to the PC. Then, click on “Get Started”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/dr_fone-change-location-pic-5.jpg"                      alt="dr.fone change location"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you have executed the prior steps or directions successfully, then you will see a new window that shows your actual location on a map will get displayed on your screen.

This will activate the teleport mode. After that, you have to enter the name of the location or place where you wish to teleport to in the upper left field. Finally, tap on “Go”.

You can confirm your location from the Pokemon Go’s map. Finally, below we have provided a screenshot of how the location will be shown.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Dr_fone-location-changed-pic-9.jpg"                      alt="Dr.fone location changed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Also, you’ll see that the location on your iPhone would have also changed now to “Italy” or any other place that you have entered earlier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/dr_fone-location-set-pic-10.jpg"                      alt="dr.fone location set"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, we have reached the end of this article.

Needless to say, there are times when players are not able to go outside to catch Pokemons due to all kinds of reasons. The good news is that you can still play your favorite game using a Pokemon Go joystick. To help you, I will let you know how to fake GPS in Pokemon Go using 3 reliable methods in this post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Joystick Hack Banner"                ></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qLfCHnwsagk"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-a-Pokemon-Go-Joystick"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-a-Pokemon-Go-Joystick" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?</h2><p>If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS&#x2F;Android under the following circumstances.</p><ul><li>In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.</li><li>You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.</li><li>There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.</li><li>The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.</li><li>Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Possible-Risks-for-Using-a-Pokemon-Go-Joystick"><a href="#Part-2-Possible-Risks-for-Using-a-Pokemon-Go-Joystick" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick"></a>Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick</h2><p>A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.</p><p>Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Warnings"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Fake-GPS-in-Pokemon-Go-3-Foolproof-Solutions"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Fake-GPS-in-Pokemon-Go-3-Foolproof-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Fake GPS in Pokemon Go: 3 Foolproof Solutions"></a>Part 3: How to Fake GPS in Pokemon Go: 3 Foolproof Solutions</h2><p>Out of all the Pokemon Go joystick and location spoofing solutions, I would recommend trying the following tools.</p><h3 id="3-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-for-iOS-No-Jailbreak-Needed"><a href="#3-1-Pokemon-Go-Joystick-for-iOS-No-Jailbreak-Needed" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Pokemon Go Joystick for iOS (No Jailbreak Needed)"></a>3.1 Pokemon Go Joystick for iOS (No Jailbreak Needed)</h3><p>If you are looking for a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS solution, then just give <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a try.

For instance, you have to walk around the street to catch as many Pokemon as possible. Another thing is that you need to visit the physical location of the PokeStops to spin the Photo Disc. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use mobile devices when streaming Pokemon Go adventures. Don’t fret. Most modern smartphones nowadays are capable of handling such demanding tasks. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide to help you get started.</p><h3 id="Check-your-mobile-device-and-internet-connection-very-well"><a href="#Check-your-mobile-device-and-internet-connection-very-well" class="headerlink" title="Check your mobile device and internet connection very well"></a>Check your mobile device and internet connection very well</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-3.JPG"                      alt="smartphone and internet power"                ></p><p>It’s fair to say that Pokemon Go streaming is not extremely particular when it comes to equipment. You can actually go live under natural daylight and document your adventure as it is. However, keep in mind that you’re simultaneously doing two different tasks in this regard. One is streaming, and the other is playing. Therefore, ensure your mobile device and internet connection can handle heavy workloads as such. A smartphone with 8 GB RAM (or higher) and an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps is highly recommended.</p><h3 id="Choose-a-live-streaming-application-and-create-an-account"><a href="#Choose-a-live-streaming-application-and-create-an-account" class="headerlink" title="Choose a live-streaming application and create an account"></a>Choose a live-streaming application and create an account</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-4.JPG"                      alt="streaming platform"                ></p><p>Of course, you can bring a full computer setup outside while exploring around.

The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo"><a href="#Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?"></a>Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?</h2><p>iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1"                ></p><p>The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.</p><p>Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer"></a>Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2"                ></p><p>It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity.

If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iOS-App-Store-pic-3"                ></p><h3 id="In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs"><a href="#In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs" class="headerlink" title="In-built spoofing with VPNs"></a>In-built spoofing with VPNs</h3><p>Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.</p><p>The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453"                      border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4"                ></p><p>If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone.

The fact that it is a location-based game and needs you to move around while playing the game makes it further interesting. Trading in Pokemon go is one of the most talked-about features. Today, we will help you explore more about stardust trade costs and how can you easily perform trades! Hang on as we dwell deeper into Pokemon go and trade stardust costs.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-does-Pokemon-trading-work"><a href="#Part-1-How-does-Pokemon-trading-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How does Pokemon trading work?"></a>Part 1: How does Pokemon trading work?</h2><p>So as we’ve discussed earlier, Pokemon go trading is one of the most interesting features of the game. So how does this trading work? In Pokemon Go, you can trade pokemon possessed by you with those possessed by your friends if both you and your friend, decide to mutually trade the pokemon with each other! For trading in Pokemon go, there are certain criteria you need to satisfy to qualify for trading in Pokemon go! Given below are the requirements to qualify for trading in Pokemon go</p><ul><li>Be at least level 10</li><li>Be friends with the person you’re trading on Pokemon go</li><li>Be in a radius of 100 m while you’re trading</li></ul><p>However, Pokemon go also has levels of friendship and you can trade pokemon of different levels with friends with whom you have different friendship levels. Higher is the friendship level, higher is the level of Pokemon which you can trade. every trade requires you and your partner to spend stardust points. So There are basically 4 levels of friendship in Pokemon go</p><ul><li>Friend</li><li>Good friend</li><li>Ultra friend</li><li>Best friend</li></ul><p>The levels of your friendship with a player on Pokemon go increase with the increase in the number of days you stay friends with them. Within a month of friendship, you can become best friends with a player on Pokemon go! You also need stardust points on Pokemon go. So what is stardust trade cost? Before you trade any pokemon you must spend stardust coins. Not having enough stardust trade coins will not allow the trade of pokemon to happen. Hence, you must have enough stardust trade costs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-much-stardust-do-you-need-in-pokemon-trading-costs"><a href="#Part-2-How-much-stardust-do-you-need-in-pokemon-trading-costs" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How much stardust do you need in pokemon trading costs?"></a>Part 2: How much stardust do you need in pokemon trading costs?</h2><p>Trading in Pokemon go is quite complex. This is because the needed Stardust points will be different in every case and will depend on several factors. Factors such as whether you already half got that Pokemon in your pokedesk or not, the friendship level of you and your friend who are interested in trading, or whether the Pokemon is rare or common. Given below are the Stardust trade costs for each Pokemon.</p><p><strong>Standard trades</strong></p><ul><li>Good friend:100</li><li>Great friends:80</li><li>Ultra Friends: 8</li><li>Best friend: 4</li></ul><p><strong>Shiny or legendary (caught by you)</strong></p><ul><li>Good Friend: 20,000</li><li>Great Friend: 16,000</li><li>Ultra Friend: 1,600</li><li>Best Friend: 800</li></ul><p><strong>Shiny or Legendary (not caught by you)</strong></p><ul><li>Good Friend: 1,000,000</li><li>Great Friend: 800,000</li><li>Ultra Friend: 80,000</li><li>Best Friend: 40,000</li></ul><p>However, this Stardust trade cost may vary according to the friendship levels! Before trading, you must think of the friendship level between you and your friend and also if the Pokemon which has been traded can be evolved through trading. Evolving Pokemon through trading is another beneficial tactic that could benefit you as a player of Pokemon go.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Ways-to-increase-stardust-in-pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-3-Ways-to-increase-stardust-in-pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Ways to increase stardust in pokemon go?"></a>Part 3: Ways to increase stardust in pokemon go?</h2><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1.

As you get exposed to such arrangements over and over, your cognitive performance further improves, too.</p><h3 id="It-can-make-an-ordinary-Pokemon-Go-player-go-global"><a href="#It-can-make-an-ordinary-Pokemon-Go-player-go-global" class="headerlink" title="It can make an ordinary Pokemon Go player go global"></a>It can make an ordinary Pokemon Go player go global</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-2.JPG"                      alt="global presence"                ></p><p>Fate works in mysterious ways.

For instance, you have to walk around the street to catch as many Pokemon as possible. Another thing is that you need to visit the physical location of the PokeStops to spin the Photo Disc. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use mobile devices when streaming Pokemon Go adventures. Don’t fret. Most modern smartphones nowadays are capable of handling such demanding tasks. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide to help you get started.</p><h3 id="Check-your-mobile-device-and-internet-connection-very-well"><a href="#Check-your-mobile-device-and-internet-connection-very-well" class="headerlink" title="Check your mobile device and internet connection very well"></a>Check your mobile device and internet connection very well</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-3.JPG"                      alt="smartphone and internet power"                ></p><p>It’s fair to say that Pokemon Go streaming is not extremely particular when it comes to equipment. You can actually go live under natural daylight and document your adventure as it is. However, keep in mind that you’re simultaneously doing two different tasks in this regard. One is streaming, and the other is playing. Therefore, ensure your mobile device and internet connection can handle heavy workloads as such. A smartphone with 8 GB RAM (or higher) and an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps is highly recommended.</p><h3 id="Choose-a-live-streaming-application-and-create-an-account"><a href="#Choose-a-live-streaming-application-and-create-an-account" class="headerlink" title="Choose a live-streaming application and create an account"></a>Choose a live-streaming application and create an account</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-4.JPG"                      alt="streaming platform"                ></p><p>Of course, you can bring a full computer setup outside while exploring around.

What Are Regional Pokemon?"></a>Part 1. What Are Regional Pokemon?</h2><p>Regional Pokemon are exclusive creatures in Niantic’s Pokemon GO AR game that only live in specific regions across the globe. The area in which a particular Pokemon can be found depends on the nature of that Pokemon. For example, Tropius can only be found in tropical parts of the continent.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Regional-Pokemon-in-Pokemon-GO-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Regional-Pokemon-in-Pokemon-GO-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Regional Pokemon in Pokemon GO Work"></a>Part 2. How Regional Pokemon in Pokemon GO Work</h2><p>Catching all Pokemon GO regional exclusive creatures and completing your Pokedex is a great challenge. There are multiple ways you can go about it, including some of the following strategies:</p><ul><li>Traveling to specific parts of the world;</li><li>Using Wondershare Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location Changer;</li><li>Waiting for special events that lift distribution restrictions;</li><li>Trading Pokemon with other players from across the globe.</li></ul><p>Avid Pokemon trainers can use one or a combination of these strategies to swiftly fill up their Pokedex with complete data about all Pokemon in the wild.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Continents-of-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-3-Continents-of-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Some are exclusive to a hemisphere, others to a continent, while the third group only spawns in a few specific countries. Keeping track of it all can be challenging, and that’s why we’ve created a detailed information table with regions and specific Pokemon GO regional exclusives you can find in each.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Region</strong></th><th><strong>Pokemon</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Africa</em></td><td>Corsola, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Pansear, Throh, Basculin, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Red Flabebe, Furfrou Trim, Oricorio, Kartana, Celesteela</td></tr><tr><td><em>Asia</em></td><td>Farfetch’d, Corsola, Volbeat, Torkoal, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pachirisu, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Fabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana Celesteela</td></tr><tr><td><em>Australia</em></td><td>Kangaskhan, Corsola, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Celesteela</td></tr><tr><td><em>Europe</em></td><td>Mr. Mime, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Mime Jr., Pansear, Sawk, Basculin, Sigilyph, Heatmor, Vivillon, Klefki, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana</td></tr><tr><td><em>Middle East</em></td><td>Corsola, Tropius, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansear, Basculin, Sawk, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana</td></tr><tr><td><em>New Zealand</em></td><td>Chatot, Relicanth, Shellos, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmore, Vivillon, Celesteela</td></tr><tr><td><em>North America</em></td><td>Tauros, Heracross, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Pachirisu, Shellos, Carnivine, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Bouffalant, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Hawlucha, Oricorio, Comfey, Kartana</td></tr><tr><td><em>South America</em></td><td>Heracross, Corsola, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Shellos, Chatot, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Celesteela</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While they’re categorized as available on the entire continent, it’s worth noting that some Pokemon can only be found in particular regions like France or Russia. To learn more about each, you’ll need to find information about their regional distribution.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Learning-About-the-Regional-Pokemon-Distribution"><a href="#Part-4-Learning-About-the-Regional-Pokemon-Distribution" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution"></a>Part 4. Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution</h2><p>With almost 60 Pokemon GO regional exclusives in 2024, keeping track of where each creature spawns can be a nightmare, especially when some Pokemon can only be found in tiny and specific areas. However, you don’t necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.</p><h3 id="Getting-Information-From-the-Community"><a href="#Getting-Information-From-the-Community" class="headerlink" title="Getting Information From the Community"></a>Getting Information From the Community</h3><p>The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community. Players can follow Pokemon GO creators, watch YouTube news channels covering new releases, and join countless forums and social media pages dedicated to the game.</p><h3 id="Using-Official-Pokemon-Go-Announcements"><a href="#Using-Official-Pokemon-Go-Announcements" class="headerlink" title="Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements"></a>Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements</h3><p>Official announcements are another way to learn more about Pokemon GO’s regional exclusives. Keeping track of these will help you track regional spawn points and special events. Enabling notifications from the game on your mobile device can also be particularly helpful in keeping track of announcements.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Quickly-Travel-to-Different-Regions"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Quickly-Travel-to-Different-Regions" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions"></a>Part 5. How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions</h2><p>While regional Pokemon GO exclusives have brought novelties to Niantic’s viral AR game, they require a lot of traveling and trading, making it significantly more challenging for players to catch them all, which is the whole point of the game.</p><p>However, there’s also an alternative to traveling and trading, as countless virtual location-changing apps can help avid Pokemon GO players catch these exclusive beasts. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a fantastic example of such a tool, and with a quick setup and a few clicks, it can help players move without moving.</p><p>Using Dr.Fone to change your virtual location is remarkably straightforward and can be done in a few steps.

This feature can be remarkably beneficial for Pokemon GO players, and here’s how you can use it:</p><ol><li>Click the <strong>Jump Teleport Mode</strong>button (the second button in the row).</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/jump-teleport-mode.png"                      alt="select dr.fone’s jump teleport mode"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>Type in and add multiple virtual locations, and click the <strong>Start Moving</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/choose-jump-teleport-destination.png"                      alt="move between multiple virtual locations"                ></p><ol start="5"><li>Switch your virtual location by clicking <strong>Next Point</strong>and <strong>Last Point</strong> to move forward or backward.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/start-use-jump-teleport-mode.png"                      alt="move along the created route"                ></p><p>Movement simulation works exceptionally well for catching Pokemon around the globe, and you’ll be able to encounter dozens of these. Use Wondershare Dr.Fone to progress swiftly through the game and catch them all!</p><h2 id="Part-6-Pokemon-GO-Regional-Spawns-and-Events"><a href="#Part-6-Pokemon-GO-Regional-Spawns-and-Events" class="headerlink" title="Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events"></a>Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events</h2><p>While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.</p><p>The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon"></a>Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon</h2><p>As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.</p><p>However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.</p><p>Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.</p><h2 id="How-Do-You-Get-Sun-Stone-Evolutions-in-Pokemon-For-Realme-Narzo-60-5G"><a href="#How-Do-You-Get-Sun-Stone-Evolutions-in-Pokemon-For-Realme-Narzo-60-5G" class="headerlink" title="How Do You Get Sun Stone Evolutions in Pokémon For Realme Narzo 60 5G?"></a>How Do You Get Sun Stone Evolutions in Pokémon For Realme Narzo 60 5G?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions.jpg"                      alt="pokémon go sun stone"                ></p><p>Though you can certainly catch some powerful Pokémon in Pokémon Go just by playing the game, exploring the wilderness, and joining raids, it’s not enough.

You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.</p><p>As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs.

There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.</p><p>You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.</p><p>To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:</p><ol><li>Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;</li><li>Connect your phone to your computer;</li><li>Go to <strong>Toolbox &gt; Virtual Location &gt; Get Started</strong>;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="get started with wondershare dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>On the map that shows up, click on <strong>No Device</strong>in the upper right-hand corner;</li><li>You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png"                      alt="choose the Realme Narzo 60 5G device you want to connect to dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>On your phone, tap <strong>Allow USB Debugging</strong>;</li><li>On your phone, go to <strong>Developer Options&gt; Select mock location app</strong>;</li><li>Select <strong>Fone</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png"                      alt="set up mock location on your phone"                ></p><p>From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement.

Wondershare Dr.Fone"></a>Part 4. <u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></h2><p>In simple terms, DeFit is a third-party application that allows trainers to play Pokemon Go without moving physically. You can walk the required distance for egg hatching or explore Routes from the comfort of your own home. However, there have been reports recently about Pokemon Go DeFit not working. Is there a substitute for this software? The short answer is absolutely yes. Wondershare Dr.Fone has a powerful Virtual Location feature that works exactly like DeFit. It can also simulate GPD movement to complete Pokemon Go Routes without going outdoors. Do you want to try it? Here’s a short guide for you.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/"><u>official website.</u></a> Right after, install it on your computer.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Open the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your smartphone immediately using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions to establish a secure connection between the computer and your device.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Access the left-side panel and then click <strong>Toolbox.</strong> Navigate to the main dashboard afterward and then click <strong>Virtual Location.</strong> If it’s your first time using this feature, let Wondershare Dr.Fone download the additional resources needed.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> After the successful download, the Virtual Location feature will then appear in a separate window. Head over to the menu bar at the top-right corner of your screen and then click <strong>One-Stop Route.</strong> The starting point for the simulation will be designated based on your current location. If you wish to change it, go back to the menu bar again and then click <strong>Teleport Mode</strong> to assign your preferred starting point. As for the destination, you can search for your desired location or tap anywhere around the map.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="wondershare drfone virtual location"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Calibrate the necessary settings according to your liking.

By far, it’s still the favorite in-game feature of many trainers all around the world. The reason is pretty obvious. You can collect tons of special rewards by doing nothing complicated other than following and completing a Route nearby. On top of that, Pokemon Go Routes can also be of great help if you’re searching for new walking paths around your location. Simply put, this particular addition to the game’s already amazing roster has many real-life and virtual benefits for the players.</p><p>However, it’s perhaps safe to say that Pokemon Go Routes is still far from perfect. There have been a few complaints from users about <strong>Pokemon Go Route not working.</strong> While this issue is fairly common among the players, the root cause differs depending on the given situation. But don’t worry. If you experience similar issues, there are many tutorials you can try to fix <strong>Pokemon Go Routes not working.</strong></p><p>In this article, we will discuss how Pokemon Go Routes basically work. We will also talk about the main reasons why <strong>Pokemon Go Routes is not showing up</strong> sometimes. Lastly, we will provide some helpful tips to fix this kind of problem. Continue reading below to learn more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-Routes-in-Pokemon-Go-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-Routes-in-Pokemon-Go-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Do Routes in Pokemon Go Work?"></a>Part 1. How Do Routes in Pokemon Go Work?</h2><p>The logic behind the Pokemon Go Routes is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember about it. First, you can record a walking path anywhere and submit it for review. Your Route will immediately appear on the Pokemon Go map once it receives approval from the game developer. Of course, the quality and safety of the Route must be checked thoroughly before it becomes available to the public. Another thing about the Route is that you can use it to discover and explore new walking paths near you. All you need to do is pick your preferred Route and finish the entire trail. Afterward, you can obtain special rewards and extra bonus points upon its completion.</p><p>Do you want to try Pokemon Go Routes now? Here’s a quick guide for you on how to access it on your mobile device.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Pokemon Go application on your smartphone.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the map view, find and click the <strong>Nearby</strong> icon at the bottom-right corner of your screen.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-1.jpg"                      alt="nearby option"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Then, click <strong>Route.</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go route"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> From there, decide if you wish to discover nearby Routes or create your own.</li></ul><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The Create New Route feature is only available to selected Pokemon Go players. If Pokemon Go Routes is not showing up on your end, it’s probably because you’re not yet eligible.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-Pokemon-Go-Routes-Not-Showing-Up"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-Pokemon-Go-Routes-Not-Showing-Up" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why is Pokemon Go Routes Not Showing Up?"></a>Part 2. Why is Pokemon Go Routes Not Showing Up?</h2><p>As previously mentioned, the root causes of the Pokemon Go Routes glitch vary from one trainer to another. It’s possible that the Pokemon Go Routes are not showing up because your Trainer Level is not high enough. Yes. This option is only available to players who reach the required level. However, the player’s respective rank is not always the culprit for this issue. There are other factors that might also result in the same problem.

You can follow the steps listed below in order to catch Pokemon by one click to go anywhere without moving.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Mocking Location Quirk:</strong></p><p>Pokemon Go can be played by using the toolkit of Dr. Fone without shifting. Open the Virtual Location feature using a functioning lightning cable to mock the location and ensure that the iOS device is linked to the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p>You can press the Get Started” button to start the process upon phone detection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Imitating Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>Open the first choice located in the top-right corner until you enter Dr.Fone’s GUI, which helps you to fake movement between the two locations. Select the location pin found in the search bar and press the “Move Here” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p>You want to make a motion, and navigate to the “March” button to start the simulation, enter the magnitude of times. By default, the movement is set to one, but the user can override it, and the application will move accordingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>For the Pokemon Go application, the new position will appear as real and will presume that you are walking between the two selected locations you have selected on the Dr. Fone screen. The walking pace can also be changed at the bottom of the screen using the sliding menu. This way, without knowing it, you can use the fake movement of the desired position, and your application will not be prohibited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>The application by Dr.Fone also helps you to mock movement between more than two spots. The function is named after the multi-stop route that can be selected from the toolbox category gui found at the top-right corner, which lets you drop different unique stops located on the map, and your location will behave accordingly as handled by Dr.Fone’s virtual location application.</p><p>Click the ‘March’ button to allow the system to simulate motion by selecting the correct options. You’ll have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. The virtual motion simulation software for Dr. Fone makes your life easier and helps you to do the job without thinking about travel costs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1892108/21290" target="_top" id="1892108"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1892108"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1892108/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="virtual location 12"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048972/16384" target="_top" id="2048972"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048972"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048972/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Requirement-and-Evolving-Pokemon’s-Using-Sinnoh-Stone"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Requirement-and-Evolving-Pokemon’s-Using-Sinnoh-Stone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Essential Requirement and Evolving Pokémon’s Using Sinnoh Stone"></a>Part 3: Essential Requirement and Evolving Pokémon’s Using Sinnoh Stone</h2><p>Only the trainers above the 10th Level have access to acquire Sinnoh Stone.

Like the Rocket Radar, the Super Rocket Radar can be equipped and unequipped from your Bag.

What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?"></a>Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?</h2><p>Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.</p><p>The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.</p><p>Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Lineup of Creature</th><th>Pokemon</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>First</td><td>Persian</td></tr><tr><td>Second</td><td>Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp</td></tr><tr><td>Third</td><td>Mewtwo</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.</p><p>When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.</p><p>Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn’t just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.</p><p>Once you defeat Team Go Rocket’s second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn’t be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.</p><p>Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Beat-Giovani-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

With that, you can use the same Pokemon twice, thereby keeping your choice for Legendary Shadow Pokemon safe till you need it to beat Giovani.</p><p>Mind you, the big bad boss, Giovani has two Protect Shields at his disposal so you have to be careful while fighting against the monster.

As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.</p><p>If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020"><a href="#Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020"></a>Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020</h2><p>A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android’s features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.</p><ul><li>If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won’t sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.</li><li>The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.</li><li>The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go spoofing risks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing"></a>Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing</h2><p>As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let’s explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.</p><h3 id="3-1-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#3-1-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Use a VPN"></a>3.1 Use a VPN</h3><p>A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.</p><p>Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here’s how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Pokemon Go on your Realme Narzo 60 5G and create your account if you haven’t already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can’t detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme Narzo 60 5G device again and access the new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg"                      alt="vpn for android"                ></p><h3 id="3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go"><a href="#3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Use Fake GPS Go"></a>3.2 Use Fake GPS Go</h3><p>If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme Narzo 60 5G device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme Narzo 60 5G and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; System &gt; About Phone and tap on the “Build Number” option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Realme Narzo 60 5G device’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg"                      alt="select Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> That’s it! Once Fake GPS Go has the needed access, you can just launch the application and manually change your location. Afterward, launch Pokemon Go to access your new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg"                      alt="launch Pokemon Go"                ></p><p>If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won’t detect its presence. Don’t worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.</p><h3 id="3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free"><a href="#3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Use Fake GPS Free"></a>3.3 Use Fake GPS Free</h3><p>This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won’t access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your device’s settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once the app is installed, go to Settings &gt; Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg"                      alt="grant Fake GPS access"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location. You can also manually zoom in or out the map to mark your new location.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-8.jpg"                      alt="Close the GPS app"                ></p><h3 id="The-final-words"><a href="#The-final-words" class="headerlink" title="The final words"></a>The final words</h3><p>There you go!

It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.</p><p>It’s an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.</p><p>You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible.

Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it.

If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.</p><p>As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.</p><p>To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You"><a href="#Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You"></a>Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You</h2><p>Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it.

To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.</p><p>With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool</strong></p><p>To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your iPhone to it.

Given below is the list of the different pokemon that can benefit from evolution.</p><ul><li>Kadabra</li><li>Machoke</li><li>Graveler</li><li>Haunter</li><li>Boldore</li><li>Gurdurr</li><li>Karrablast</li><li>Shelmet</li></ul><p>However, trading Pokemons in Pokemon go could be slightly tricky without having at least one close friend in the games who is also of a considerable level. Only then, you will be able to evolve your pokemon by trading.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-do-the-special-trade"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-do-the-special-trade" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to do the special trade?"></a>Part 3: How to do the special trade?</h2><p>You need a Special Trade whenever you wish to trade a legendary Pokemon or a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go. These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It’ll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082529/7443" target="_top" id="2082529"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082529"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Trading in Pokemon go was introduced in recent times and had now become one of the most integral factors of the game. Pokemon go trading has changed the gaming trend. However, you could get an upper hand by using a virtual location changer such as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles"></a>Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles</h2><p>To get the best out of Pokémon Go battle another trainer it is advised to get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower.

Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

Ideally, you can partake in a Pokemon PvP battle locally or remotely. It is a 3 vs. 3 battle in which you have to select your best Pokemons to fight with other trainers. To help you become a PvP Poke master, I have come up with this detailed guide that will certainly come in handy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-pvp-battle-tips-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battle tips banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>If you want to be good at the Pokemon Go PvP battles, then you must understand how the game works. Once you are ready, I would recommend some of these Pokemon PvP strategies that are followed by pro players.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues"><a href="#Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Start from the low leagues"></a>Tip 1: Start from the low leagues</h3><p>As you know, there are three different leagues to participate in Pokemon Go PvP battles. If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Great League:</strong> Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Ultra League:</strong> Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Master League:</strong> No CP limit</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="leagues in pokemon pvp"                ></p><p>The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons. The Great League is the best category to learn and try different Pokemon combinations.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves"><a href="#Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves"></a>Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves</h3><p>Ideally, there are four different moves in any PvP Poke battle that you must master. The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.</p><ul><li><strong>Fast attacks:</strong> These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.</li><li><strong>Charge attack:</strong> Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.</li><li><strong>Shield:</strong> This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.</li><li><strong>Swapping:</strong> Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons"><a href="#Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons"></a>Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons</h3><p>This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/opponent-screen-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="opponent screen pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta"><a href="#Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Know the current Meta"></a>Tip 4: Know the current Meta</h3><p>In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.</p><p>There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy"><a href="#Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy"></a>Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy</h3><p>This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.</p><p>Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves"><a href="#Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves"></a>Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves</h3><p>To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.</p><p>During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/fast-moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="fast moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap"><a href="#Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap"></a>Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap</h3><p>This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.</p><p>In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP"><a href="#Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?"></a>Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?</h2><p>Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.</p><ul><li>The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.</li><li>Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.</li><li>Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.</li><li>The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.</li><li>The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-iv-level-trick-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="cp iv level trick pokemon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?"></a>Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?</h2><p>During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Team composition</strong></li></ul><p>Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.</p><ul><li><strong>Focus on attacks</strong></li></ul><p>Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider Pokemon Stats</strong></li></ul><p>Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice. Besides that, you should also do some research about the Meta tier in Pokemon PvP to know the best picks of the present time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg"                      alt="meta pokemons in pvp"                ></p><p>Most of the experts consider the following points while picking any Pokemon in PvP battles.</p><ul><li><strong>Lead</strong></li></ul><p>Firstly, focus on getting a Pokemon that can help you maintain a lead in the battle right from the start. You can consider getting Altaria, Deoxys, or Mantine as they are the strongest attackers.</p><ul><li><strong>Attacker</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to fight more aggressively in the Pokemon PvP battle, then consider getting some attackers like Bastiodon, Medicham, and Whiscash.</p><ul><li><strong>Defender</strong></li></ul><p>While making your Pokemon PvP team, make sure that you have at least one strong defender like Froslass, Zweilous, or Swampert.</p><ul><li><strong>Closer</strong></li></ul><p>In the end, make sure that you have a perfect Pokemon that can end the battle and secure a win. Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="skarmory in pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.</p><ul><li><strong>Turns</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong></li></ul><p>You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.</p><ul><li><strong>Switching</strong></li></ul><p>Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mechanism-in-pokemon-pvp-battle.jpg"                      alt="mechanism in pokemon pvp battle"                ></p><p>There you go!

Here’s how you can use this Pokemon Go APK for rooted devices.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install the Pokemon Go Spoofer APK</strong></p><p>At first, make sure that your Realme Narzo 60 5G is rooted before you install this Pokemon Go APK hack. Later, you can go to its website or any third-party installer to get the location spoofer app.</p><p>You can now launch the application and go to its Settings to enable the Root Mode. Also, make it the default mock location app by visiting the Developer Option on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-8.jpg"                      alt="FGL Pro Root Mode"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Start Simulating the movement of your Realme Narzo 60 5G</strong></p><p>Great!

It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.</p></li><li><p>Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.</p></li><li><p>Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-10.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Cooldown Chart"                ></p></li><li><p>Make sure that the Pokemon Go joystick you are using is a reliable solution (like the ones listed above).</p></li><li><p>If you have already got a warning on your Pokemon Go account, then consider creating another account for using any fake GPS Pokemon Go hack instead.</p></li></ul><p>There you go! By now, you would be able to implement these spoofing Pokemon Go tips and tricks. As you can see, there can be so many Pokemon Go spoofing iOS&#x2F;Android solutions that you can explore.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-Can-I-Catch-the-Regional-Pokemon-without-Traveling-On-Realme-Narzo-60-5G"><a href="#How-Can-I-Catch-the-Regional-Pokemon-without-Traveling-On-Realme-Narzo-60-5G" class="headerlink" title="How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Realme Narzo 60 5G"></a>How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Realme Narzo 60 5G</h2><p>The main goal that the designers of Pokémon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pokémon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced"><a href="#Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced"></a>Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced</h2><p>Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.</p><p>These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.</p><p>There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle.

When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.</p><ul><li><strong>Curve Ball:</strong> Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.</li><li><strong>Maximize your Medals:</strong> Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.</li><li><strong>Keep Consistent:</strong> The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.</li><li><strong>Save your Berries:</strong> Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.</li><li><strong>Use Powerful Poke balls:</strong> Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.</p><h2 id="Ultimate-guide-to-get-the-meltan-box-pokemon-go-For-Realme-Narzo-60-5G"><a href="#Ultimate-guide-to-get-the-meltan-box-pokemon-go-For-Realme-Narzo-60-5G" class="headerlink" title="Ultimate guide to get the meltan box pokemon go For Realme Narzo 60 5G"></a>Ultimate guide to get the meltan box pokemon go For Realme Narzo 60 5G</h2><p>If you are a huge Pokemon fan and loves to play pokemon go, you will definitely be aware of the latest addition to this family- meltan.

At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.</p><p>To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the ‘March’ button.

It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Let’s Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.</p><p>The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-home-vs-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon home vs pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokémon is one of the most enjoyable games, not only because it yields prizes such as the mystery box Pokémon, Meltan Pokémon, shiny Meltan Pokémon go, but it also develops players’ interest completely.

Ideally, you can partake in a Pokemon PvP battle locally or remotely. It is a 3 vs. 3 battle in which you have to select your best Pokemons to fight with other trainers. To help you become a PvP Poke master, I have come up with this detailed guide that will certainly come in handy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-pvp-battle-tips-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battle tips banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>If you want to be good at the Pokemon Go PvP battles, then you must understand how the game works. Once you are ready, I would recommend some of these Pokemon PvP strategies that are followed by pro players.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues"><a href="#Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Start from the low leagues"></a>Tip 1: Start from the low leagues</h3><p>As you know, there are three different leagues to participate in Pokemon Go PvP battles. If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Great League:</strong> Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Ultra League:</strong> Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Master League:</strong> No CP limit</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="leagues in pokemon pvp"                ></p><p>The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons. The Great League is the best category to learn and try different Pokemon combinations.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves"><a href="#Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves"></a>Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves</h3><p>Ideally, there are four different moves in any PvP Poke battle that you must master. The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.</p><ul><li><strong>Fast attacks:</strong> These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.</li><li><strong>Charge attack:</strong> Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.</li><li><strong>Shield:</strong> This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.</li><li><strong>Swapping:</strong> Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons"><a href="#Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons"></a>Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons</h3><p>This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/opponent-screen-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="opponent screen pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta"><a href="#Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Know the current Meta"></a>Tip 4: Know the current Meta</h3><p>In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.</p><p>There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy"><a href="#Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy"></a>Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy</h3><p>This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.</p><p>Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087407/7443" target="_top" id="2087407"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087407"                      border="0" alt="" width="600" height="500"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves"><a href="#Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves"></a>Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves</h3><p>To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.</p><p>During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/fast-moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="fast moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap"><a href="#Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap"></a>Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap</h3><p>This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.</p><p>In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP"><a href="#Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?"></a>Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?</h2><p>Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.</p><ul><li>The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.</li><li>Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.</li><li>Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.</li><li>The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.</li><li>The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-iv-level-trick-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="cp iv level trick pokemon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?"></a>Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?</h2><p>During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Team composition</strong></li></ul><p>Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.</p><ul><li><strong>Focus on attacks</strong></li></ul><p>Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider Pokemon Stats</strong></li></ul><p>Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice. Besides that, you should also do some research about the Meta tier in Pokemon PvP to know the best picks of the present time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meta-pokemons-in-pvp.jpg"                      alt="meta pokemons in pvp"                ></p><p>Most of the experts consider the following points while picking any Pokemon in PvP battles.</p><ul><li><strong>Lead</strong></li></ul><p>Firstly, focus on getting a Pokemon that can help you maintain a lead in the battle right from the start. You can consider getting Altaria, Deoxys, or Mantine as they are the strongest attackers.</p><ul><li><strong>Attacker</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to fight more aggressively in the Pokemon PvP battle, then consider getting some attackers like Bastiodon, Medicham, and Whiscash.</p><ul><li><strong>Defender</strong></li></ul><p>While making your Pokemon PvP team, make sure that you have at least one strong defender like Froslass, Zweilous, or Swampert.</p><ul><li><strong>Closer</strong></li></ul><p>In the end, make sure that you have a perfect Pokemon that can end the battle and secure a win. Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="skarmory in pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.</p><ul><li><strong>Turns</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong></li></ul><p>You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.</p><ul><li><strong>Switching</strong></li></ul><p>Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://mushroom-supplies.sjv.io/c/5597632/1692242/18134" target="_top" id="1692242"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18134-1692242"                      border="0" alt="" width="834" height="592"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1692242/18134"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mechanism-in-pokemon-pvp-battle.jpg"                      alt="mechanism in pokemon pvp battle"                ></p><p>There you go!

You’ll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pokémon. Depending on the species, you’ll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don’t worry, evolutions don’t affect the total number of Pokémon in your collection).</p><p>Depending on the specific Pokémon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).</p><p>You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones"><a href="#Part-3-Which-Pokemon-Evolve-With-Sun-Stones" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Only the lucky few are able to come across it randomly, as it comes with a mere 1% drop chance.</p><p>Fortunately, for all those unlucky ones, you can acquire the Sun Stone to complete your Pokémon evolutions in a few different ways.</p><h3 id="Special-Events"><a href="#Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="Special Events"></a>Special Events</h3><p>Partaking in Pokémon Go special events is almost always a lucrative experience. You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pokémon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.</p><p>Pokémon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:</p><ul><li>Lunar New Year – February 5 to February 11;</li><li>Carnival of Love – February 13 to February 15;</li><li>Road to Sinnoh – February 19 to February 23.</li></ul><p>You’ll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a Sun Stone, there’s always a possibility!</p><h3 id="Field-Research"><a href="#Field-Research" class="headerlink" title="Field Research"></a>Field Research</h3><p>Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pokémon, so he’ll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.</p><p>As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Special-Research"><a href="#Special-Research" class="headerlink" title="Special Research"></a>Special Research</h3><p>With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.</p><p>Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.</p><p>As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.</p><h3 id="Gyms-and-PokeStops"><a href="#Gyms-and-PokeStops" class="headerlink" title="Gyms and PokeStops"></a>Gyms and PokeStops</h3><p>Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs.

However, that doesn’t mean you’ll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.</p><h3 id="Complete-Field-Research-Tasks-Quickly"><a href="#Complete-Field-Research-Tasks-Quickly" class="headerlink" title="Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly"></a>Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly</h3><p>Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.</p><p>To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you’ll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.</p><p>Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.</p><p>You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.</p><p>To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:</p><ol><li>Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;</li><li>Connect your phone to your computer;</li><li>Go to <strong>Toolbox &gt; Virtual Location &gt; Get Started</strong>;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="get started with wondershare dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="4"><li>On the map that shows up, click on <strong>No Device</strong>in the upper right-hand corner;</li><li>You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png"                      alt="choose the Realme Narzo 60 5G device you want to connect to dr.fone"                ></p><ol start="6"><li>On your phone, tap <strong>Allow USB Debugging</strong>;</li><li>On your phone, go to <strong>Developer Options&gt; Select mock location app</strong>;</li><li>Select <strong>Fone</strong>.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png"                      alt="set up mock location on your phone"                ></p><p>From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement. With Wondershare Dr.Fone, you’ll have intuitive keyboard controls, 360-degree directions, and automated movement. So, as soon as you set things up in the app, you can start playing the game, completing your field research tasks, and, hopefully, acquiring your Sun Stones.</p><h3 id="Pay-Attention-to-Community-Days-and-Special-Events"><a href="#Pay-Attention-to-Community-Days-and-Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events"></a>Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events</h3><p>Finally, to start getting Sun Stones and other rarer items more efficiently, you’ll always want to pay close attention to community days and special events. Pokémon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you’ll always want to know precisely when they start and end.</p><p>Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pokémon Go on social media or visit the official Pokémon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Acquiring Sun Stones for Pokémon evolutions can be quite a hassle. This rare evolution item can be a tricky find. Still, simply playing the game and joining all events, completing your research tasks, and more can significantly increase your chances of coming across a Sun Stone – especially if you have the help of apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-screen-recording-through-built-in-features-of-huaweis-mate-and-p-devices-p20-p10-for-2024/"><u>[New] Screen Recording Through Built-In Features of Huawei's Mate and P Devices (P20, P10) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-crafting-a-top-notch-linkedin-image/"><u>[Updated] Crafting a Top-Notch LinkedIn Image</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-solutions-for-hidden-youtube-shorts-thumbnail-problems/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Solutions for Hidden YouTube Shorts Thumbnail Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-vlogging-with-top-12-innovative-screen-swivel-cams/"><u>[Updated] Mastering Vlogging with Top 12 Innovative Screen Swivel Cams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-must-visit-websites-for-text-design-elements-download/"><u>2024 Approved  Must-Visit Websites for Text Design Elements Download</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-snappy-adjustments-the-art-of-perfecting-photos-on-snapchat/"><u>2024 Approved  Snappy Adjustments  The Art of Perfecting Photos on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-tips-for-perfect-iptv-stream-snapping/"><u>2024 Approved  Tips for Perfect IPTV Stream Snapping</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/4-solution-to-get-rid-of-pokemon-fail-to-detect-location-on-honor-x50-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>4 solution to get rid of pokemon fail to detect location On Honor X50 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-nubia-red-magic-9-proplus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>9 Mind-Blowing Tricks to Hatch Eggs in Pokemon Go Without Walking On Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-mega-greninja-for-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>All You Need To Know About Mega Greninja For Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/basic-tips-for-windows-clown-phonetics-modification/"><u>Basic Tips for Windows Clown Phonetics Modification</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/best-pokemons-for-pvp-matches-in-pokemon-go-for-honor-play-40c-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Best Pokemons for PVP Matches in Pokemon Go For Honor Play 40C | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-nubia-red-magic-9-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>CatchEmAll Celebrate National Pokémon Day with Virtual Location On Nubia Red Magic 9 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/convenient-alias-adjustment-in-google-meet-devices-for-2024/"><u>Convenient Alias Adjustment in Google Meet Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/here-are-some-pro-tips-for-pokemon-go-pvp-battles-on-poco-f5-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Here are Some Pro Tips for Pokemon Go PvP Battles On Poco F5 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/here-are-some-reliable-ways-to-get-pokemon-go-friend-codes-for-nubia-red-magic-8s-proplus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Here Are Some Reliable Ways to Get Pokemon Go Friend Codes For Nubia Red Magic 8S Pro+ | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-can-i-get-more-stardust-in-pokemon-go-on-honor-x50-gt-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How can I get more stardust in pokemon go On Honor X50 GT?
