If you want accurate, useful information from an AI chatbot, crafting a prompt properly is important.</p><p> But it’s not always easy. How specific should you be? What information should you include? And how do you request your data in a useful format?</p><p> A whole new world of prompt engineering is springing into life, all dedicated to crafting and perfecting the art of AI prompting. But you can skip the tricky bits and improve your AI prompting game with these tips and tricks.</p><h2 id="1-Be-as-Specific-as-Possible"><a href="#1-Be-as-Specific-as-Possible" class="headerlink" title="1 Be as Specific as Possible"></a>1 Be as Specific as Possible</h2><p> One<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-prompt-mistakes-to-avoid/" >ChatGPT prompt mistake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is not being specific with the information you give, and this is also a problem when using Microsoft Copilot and other AI tools. If you want AI to provide more accurate results, you need to tell it exactly what you’re looking for.p</p><p> For example, let’s say that you want your AI tool to generate a new gym workout plan. If you simply say something like, “Please create a gym plan for five days per week,” you’ll get generic results. Instead, a better prompt is:</p><blockquote><p>“Please create a fitness and diet plan that involves five workouts per week. I want to combine weightlifting with high-intensity interval training and have been regularly exercising for 10 years. I’m 28 years old, 6 ft, and 90 kilograms. I don’t have any allergies, but I am sensitive to rice and don’t want to drink alcohol.”</p></blockquote><p> As you can see below, we’ve received more of a customized workout plan with the types of exercises that we wanted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-12-59-46.png"                      alt="A gym routine generated with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> The more context you provide your AI tool, the better of a response you’ll receive.</p><h2 id="2-Ask-for-More-Information-After-Getting-an-Initial-Answer"><a href="#2-Ask-for-More-Information-After-Getting-an-Initial-Answer" class="headerlink" title="2 Ask for More Information After Getting an Initial Answer"></a>2 Ask for More Information After Getting an Initial Answer</h2><p> As you use tools like ChatGPT more frequently, you’ll quickly learn that the first answer you get shouldn’t always be taken as is. In the same way that you’d ask a person further questions to get more information out of them, you should do the same when prompting with AI.</p><p> This time, we’ve asked our AI tool to give us a three-day San Francisco itinerary for a couple’s trip. Using the first tip mentioned in this guide and being more specific, we got a pretty good outline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-06-24.png"                      alt="An itinerary generated with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> However, I wanted to get further information that wasn’t included. So, I asked for hotel recommendations within a customized budget:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-11-12.png"                      alt="An expanded answer with ChatGPT"                ></p><p> As a general rule of thumb, ask as many questions as you feel necessary to get all the information you’re looking for. You may also want to determine<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/should-you-buy-ai-prompts/" >whether premium AI prompts are worth the money <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="3-Explain-What-Hasn’t-Worked-When-You’ve-Prompted-in-the-Past"><a href="#3-Explain-What-Hasn’t-Worked-When-You’ve-Prompted-in-the-Past" class="headerlink" title="3 Explain What Hasn’t Worked When You’ve Prompted in the Past"></a>3 Explain What Hasn’t Worked When You’ve Prompted in the Past</h2><p> As you use AI prompting more frequently, you’ll get a better idea of what does and doesn’t work for you. You’ll also learn which prompts are useful and which ones confuse the tool that you’re using. Once you’ve become more familiar with AI, make sure that you clearly outline what hasn’t worked before.</p><p> This tip is especially important if you want to use AI tools like DALL-E 3 to generate images. I’ve often noticed that first drafts sometimes don’t yield what I’m looking for, and there could also be problems like defects for items like flags.</p><p> Besides mentioning what hasn’t worked for you when prompting in the past, you may also wish to outline anything that has not worked with what you’re trying to do. For example, if you’re putting together a new workout regimen, you may want to talk about which foods you’ve noticed you have a negative reaction to before.</p><h2 id="4-Don’t-Make-Your-AI-Multitask"><a href="#4-Don’t-Make-Your-AI-Multitask" class="headerlink" title="4 Don’t Make Your AI Multitask"></a>4 Don’t Make Your AI Multitask</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://thmb.techidaily.com/7dd47039b908f15adfac56204ff22ad7becb8a002a35f04201c966ce7066b460.jpg"                      alt="chatgpt logo and message on smartphone feature"                ></p><p> Ascannio&#x2F;<a class="link"   href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/chatgpt-chat-bot-screen-seen-on-2237655785" >Shutterstock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/mistakes-generative-ai-tools/" >Avoiding common mistakes when using AI prompting tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> isn’t always easy, but one of the main issues you’ll encounter is trying to make the tool multitask. AI programs will often generate your results within a few minutes, but they can only do one thing at a time. If you try to ask too many things in one go, you won’t get the results you want.</p><p> Sometimes, you’ll begin a prompt and realize you forgot to add further information. When this happens, stop or edit the current prompt and include those details before re-generating your answer.</p><p> Once you’ve received one prompt’s results, you can move on to the next one until you’re happy with everything. Doing things this way might seem more time-consuming, but<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/master-single-tasking-using-technology-improve-productivity/" >single-tasking often improves productivity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and it’s the same for your AI, too.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118318/7443" target="_top" id="2118318">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118318" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118318/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="5-Tell-Your-AI-Tool-What-You-Don’t-Want-in-Your-Answer"><a href="#5-Tell-Your-AI-Tool-What-You-Don’t-Want-in-Your-Answer" class="headerlink" title="5 Tell Your AI Tool What You Don’t Want in Your Answer"></a>5 Tell Your AI Tool What You Don’t Want in Your Answer</h2><p> Do you remember in our first point when we told you to be as specific as possible? This also means you should let your AI tool know what you don’t want in your answers. While generative AI can produce some pretty cool results, it can’t guess everything for you.</p><p> When designing your prompt, be very specific about what you don’t want in your results. For example, if you’re planning a trip, you may want to mention that you don’t want to join tours or would prefer to avoid popular spots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-38-46.png"                      alt="Answer options from ChatGPT, based on what the user did and didn&#39;t want "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135365/19272" target="_top" id="2135365">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135365" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="125" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135365/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Sometimes, your AI tool will give you multiple options in your answers. You can then choose whichever one works best for you.</p><h2 id="6-Upload-Images-or-Files-if-Available"><a href="#6-Upload-Images-or-Files-if-Available" class="headerlink" title="6 Upload Images or Files (if Available)"></a>6 Upload Images or Files (if Available)</h2><p> Uploading images or files will often make your AI prompts much more effective. For example, if you want to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/create-one-page-resume/" >create a one-page resume with AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it’s worth uploading an existing PDF and getting feedback. You can use several plugins to get better responses, especially if you use ChatGPT. One example is<a class="link"   href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-MrgKnTZbc-resume" >Resume by jobbright.ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> If you’re using AI to create art, it’s also a good idea to upload images that the AI tool can use as examples. Meanwhile, if you want to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-photo-ai/" >use Photo AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or similar tools for pictures of yourself, uploading selfies, headshots, and other images will help you achieve what you want.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/ai-tools-answer-pdf/" >Some AI tools can even answer questions from your PDFs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to get more clarity.</p><h2 id="7-Mention-Where-You-Want-to-Use-Your-Prompt-Answers"><a href="#7-Mention-Where-You-Want-to-Use-Your-Prompt-Answers" class="headerlink" title="7 Mention Where You Want to Use Your Prompt Answers"></a>7 Mention Where You Want to Use Your Prompt Answers</h2><p> Sometimes, the results your AI prompts generate won’t be useful for the place you want to use them. For example, if you want to create a post for Instagram, you probably don’t want your tool to provide huge bodies of text. On the other hand, you might want something more formal if you’re going to<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/linkedin-how-to-improve-profile-with-ai/" >improve your LinkedIn profile with AI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> If you use the information from your AI prompt online, it’s worth specifically mentioning where you’ll use it. That way, you won’t need to edit your results as much.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/screenshot-2024-04-08-at-13-54-04.png"                      alt="A LinkedIn post generated with ChatGPT"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> AI prompting takes some time to become competent with, and you’ll need to adjust how you type depending on the tool you use and the information you wish to extract. The good news, however, is that you normally only need small tweaks to make your prompts deliver better results. Having read this guide, you should now be in a much better place to prompt more efficiently.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/new-10-shopping-powerhouses-where-to-buy-personalized-present-wrappers/"><u>[New] 10 Shopping Powerhouses Where to Buy Personalized Present Wrappers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-spotlight-on-top-8-authentic-youtube-growth-tactics/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Spotlight on Top 8 Authentic YouTube Growth Tactics</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-brand-your-channel-innovative-banner-templates-for-gamers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Brand Your Channel Innovative Banner Templates for Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/a-working-guide-for-pachirisu-pokemon-go-map-on-honor-80-pro-straight-screen-edition-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Honor 80 Pro Straight Screen Edition | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/a-working-guide-for-pachirisu-pokemon-go-map-on-realme-12-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Realme 12 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/comprehensive-fixes-to-address-missing-user32dll-errors-in-windows-systems/"><u>Comprehensive Fixes to Address Missing User32.dll Errors in Windows Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/crafting-an-aural-experience-for-previews-for-2024/"><u>Crafting an Aural Experience for Previews for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-meizu-phone-without-pin-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Meizu Phone without PIN</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-pokemons-for-pvp-matches-in-pokemon-go-for-honor-x50i-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Pokemons for PVP Matches in Pokemon Go For Honor X50i | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-catch-or-beat-sleeping-snorlax-on-pokemon-go-for-tecno-spark-20c-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Catch or Beat Sleeping Snorlax on Pokemon Go For Tecno Spark 20C | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-here-are-some-of-the-best-pokemon-discord-servers-to-join-on-apple-iphone-15-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Here are Some of the Best Pokemon Discord Servers to Join On Apple iPhone 15 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-resolving-silence-in-tweeted-video-playbacks/"><u>In 2024, Resolving Silence in Tweeted Video Playbacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-magnificent-art-of-pokemon-go-streaming-on-google-pixel-fold-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, The Magnificent Art of Pokemon Go Streaming On Google Pixel Fold? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/is-gsm-flasher-adb-legit-full-review-to-bypass-your-vivo-t2-5g-phone-frp-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Is GSM Flasher ADB Legit?

If you decide to spoof too quickly, you will automatically trigger a soft ban, and you will not be able to play most parts of the game like catching Pokemon or spinning Pokestops. If this occurs consistently over multiple occasions, it will trigger Niantic’s warning and may end up getting a permanent ban. It has a 3-strike policy. 3 warnings are given before the account is permanently deleted.</p><p>The notice looks like this -</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-account-ban.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go account ban"                ></p><p>The cool-down period between two locations is based on distance and you can refer to the table below to understand the time you need to wait before logging in again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/cooldown-time.jpg"                      alt="cooldown time"                ></p><p>Most gamers wait for the standard 2 hours before logging in again.

When you lob a Pokéball at a Pokémon, there are chances that it could escape.</p><p>What if there was a way in which you could catch a Pokémon creature every time, even Legendary Pokémon?</p><p>The Pokémon emerald master ball can do this with no effort on your part. Simply activate the ball and the Pokémon is captured. This makes the emerald Pokémon master ball a very important asset. In this article, you get to know all the Pokémon master ball cheat codes that you can use to get these valuable assets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/masterball-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="An image of a Pokémon Master Ball"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Catch Pokémon like a Pro with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location!

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”. Now set it to “autodetect” and you will be able to get Pokémon Master Emerald Balls at any time you wish.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-get-unlimited-master-balls-in-Pokemon-Emerald"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-get-unlimited-master-balls-in-Pokemon-Emerald" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How do you get unlimited master balls in Pokémon Emerald?"></a>Part 3: How do you get unlimited master balls in Pokémon Emerald?</h2><p>There are ways in which you can get unlimited Pokémon Master Balls using the Pokémon emerald Master Ball cheat codes available today.</p><p><strong>Step 1 -</strong> Save your game</p><p>When you are using Pokémon game emulators such as the GameShark, you can take a snapshot of the game and save it. This enables you to quickly come back to this point should anything go wrong when trying to use the cheat codes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-1.jpg"                      alt="Save the game state"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2 –</strong> Now hit the “Cheats” menu and then choose the “Cheat List”.

The small cod will have to be enabled before you can switch on the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball GameShark cheat code. To do this, Go to the description and then enter the master code. Now you need to paste in the following into the “Code Field”.<br><strong>D8BAE4D9 4864DCE5</strong></p><p><strong>Step 5 –</strong> Now proceed and enter all the codes for the Master Balls. All you have to do is enter any sort of gibberish that you want into the description and then enter the code shown above. You will now be able to get an unlimited number of Pokémon Emerald Master balls which you can use to capture as many Pokémon characters as you wish.</p><p><strong>Step 6 –</strong> Proceed and enter a PokeMart and then buy Pokeballs. When you have entered the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball code, you are allowed to buy as many of these as you can fit in your bag. All you have to do is go up to the register and then buy a Pokéball, and you will get a Master Ball instead, without having to pay a dime.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-4.jpg"                      alt="Enter PokeMart to but Pokémon Emerald Master Balls"                ></p><p>Only one Master Ball can be bought at a time, but you can do this as many times as you want.

Now there are very many ways in which you can amass XP but we shall look at some of the best and easiest ways to go about this.</p><p>Here are a few of the best ways to go about this:</p><h3 id="Mass-Friending"><a href="#Mass-Friending" class="headerlink" title="Mass Friending"></a>Mass Friending</h3><p>Having a lot of friends is not what gets you XP, but the quality of friends that you have. Here is what you get from having high-quality friends.</p><ul><li>3,000 XP for a Great Friend</li><li>50,000 XP for an Ultra Friend</li><li>100,000 XP for a Best Friend</li></ul><p>Timing the way your friendship levels up, and then dropping a Lucky Egg will hugely boost your XP. However, you can only use this process once for every friend per day. This method is great but it would take you 3 months for any friend to become a Best Friend.</p><h3 id="Mass-Raids"><a href="#Mass-Raids" class="headerlink" title="Mass Raids"></a>Mass Raids</h3><p>Raiding Gyms can get you a lot of XP. This is more so when you go for Legendary Raids. You can get up to 10,000 XP for getting into a Legendary Raid. This becomes 20,000 XP if you have a Lucky Egg and 40,000 XP if you use a double XP event together with a Lucky Egg.</p><p><strong>How do you go about this?</strong></p><ul><li>Add up your stockpile of Premium Raid Passes</li><li>Join a local Raid group through Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, or other social networks that they use.</li><li>Fix up a Raid Train, which is the process of moving from one Raid to another as a group, and this allows you to Raid as much as possible in a short time.</li></ul><p>Do as many of these Raids as you can.</p><h3 id="Mass-catching-and-Mass-evolving"><a href="#Mass-catching-and-Mass-evolving" class="headerlink" title="Mass catching and Mass evolving"></a>Mass catching and Mass evolving</h3><p>You can also catch as many Pokémon as you can and then use a Lucky Egg and their Candies to evolve them at the same time.

It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Let’s Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.</p><p>The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour.

Developed by Niantic for iOS and Android, this single console game lets us catch all sorts of Pokemons in different areas. Though, to catch Pokemons, users are expected to visit different places and step out. Needless to say, it restricts the scope to <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/pokemon-go/best-pokemon-type.html" >catch Pokemons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and users often look for Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android. This would let you change your location and <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/android-location/" >spoof Pokemon Go on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> pretty easily.</p><p>In this guide, I will teach you how to use reliable Android Pokemon Go spoof apps and the risks related to them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-so-many-people-seek-Pokemon-Go-spoofing-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Why-so-many-people-seek-Pokemon-Go-spoofing-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?"></a>Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?</h2><p>Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.</p><p>If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020"><a href="#Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020"></a>Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020</h2><p>A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android’s features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.</p><ul><li>If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won’t sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.</li><li>The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.</li><li>The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go spoofing risks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing"></a>Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing</h2><p>As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let’s explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.</p><h3 id="3-1-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#3-1-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Use a VPN"></a>3.1 Use a VPN</h3><p>A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.</p><p>Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here’s how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Pokemon Go on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G and create your account if you haven’t already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can’t detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device again and access the new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg"                      alt="vpn for android"                ></p><h3 id="3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go"><a href="#3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Use Fake GPS Go"></a>3.2 Use Fake GPS Go</h3><p>If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; System &gt; About Phone and tap on the “Build Number” option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg"                      alt="select Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> That’s it! Once Fake GPS Go has the needed access, you can just launch the application and manually change your location. Afterward, launch Pokemon Go to access your new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg"                      alt="launch Pokemon Go"                ></p><p>If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won’t detect its presence. Don’t worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.</p><h3 id="3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free"><a href="#3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Use Fake GPS Free"></a>3.3 Use Fake GPS Free</h3><p>This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won’t access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your device’s settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once the app is installed, go to Settings &gt; Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg"                      alt="grant Fake GPS access"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location. You can also manually zoom in or out the map to mark your new location.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-8.jpg"                      alt="Close the GPS app"                ></p><h3 id="The-final-words"><a href="#The-final-words" class="headerlink" title="The final words"></a>The final words</h3><p>There you go!

Hang on as we dwell deeper into Pokemon go and trade stardust costs.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-does-Pokemon-trading-work"><a href="#Part-1-How-does-Pokemon-trading-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How does Pokemon trading work?"></a>Part 1: How does Pokemon trading work?</h2><p>So as we’ve discussed earlier, Pokemon go trading is one of the most interesting features of the game. So how does this trading work? In Pokemon Go, you can trade pokemon possessed by you with those possessed by your friends if both you and your friend, decide to mutually trade the pokemon with each other! For trading in Pokemon go, there are certain criteria you need to satisfy to qualify for trading in Pokemon go! Given below are the requirements to qualify for trading in Pokemon go</p><ul><li>Be at least level 10</li><li>Be friends with the person you’re trading on Pokemon go</li><li>Be in a radius of 100 m while you’re trading</li></ul><p>However, Pokemon go also has levels of friendship and you can trade pokemon of different levels with friends with whom you have different friendship levels. Higher is the friendship level, higher is the level of Pokemon which you can trade. every trade requires you and your partner to spend stardust points. So There are basically 4 levels of friendship in Pokemon go</p><ul><li>Friend</li><li>Good friend</li><li>Ultra friend</li><li>Best friend</li></ul><p>The levels of your friendship with a player on Pokemon go increase with the increase in the number of days you stay friends with them. Within a month of friendship, you can become best friends with a player on Pokemon go! You also need stardust points on Pokemon go. So what is stardust trade cost? Before you trade any pokemon you must spend stardust coins. Not having enough stardust trade coins will not allow the trade of pokemon to happen. Hence, you must have enough stardust trade costs.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-much-stardust-do-you-need-in-pokemon-trading-costs"><a href="#Part-2-How-much-stardust-do-you-need-in-pokemon-trading-costs" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How much stardust do you need in pokemon trading costs?"></a>Part 2: How much stardust do you need in pokemon trading costs?</h2><p>Trading in Pokemon go is quite complex. This is because the needed Stardust points will be different in every case and will depend on several factors. Factors such as whether you already half got that Pokemon in your pokedesk or not, the friendship level of you and your friend who are interested in trading, or whether the Pokemon is rare or common. Given below are the Stardust trade costs for each Pokemon.</p><p><strong>Standard trades</strong></p><ul><li>Good friend:100</li><li>Great friends:80</li><li>Ultra Friends: 8</li><li>Best friend: 4</li></ul><p><strong>Shiny or legendary (caught by you)</strong></p><ul><li>Good Friend: 20,000</li><li>Great Friend: 16,000</li><li>Ultra Friend: 1,600</li><li>Best Friend: 800</li></ul><p><strong>Shiny or Legendary (not caught by you)</strong></p><ul><li>Good Friend: 1,000,000</li><li>Great Friend: 800,000</li><li>Ultra Friend: 80,000</li><li>Best Friend: 40,000</li></ul><p>However, this Stardust trade cost may vary according to the friendship levels! Before trading, you must think of the friendship level between you and your friend and also if the Pokemon which has been traded can be evolved through trading. Evolving Pokemon through trading is another beneficial tactic that could benefit you as a player of Pokemon go.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Ways-to-increase-stardust-in-pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-3-Ways-to-increase-stardust-in-pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Ways to increase stardust in pokemon go?"></a>Part 3: Ways to increase stardust in pokemon go?</h2><h3 id="1-Use-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Dr-Fone-–-Virtual-Location-iOS-Android" class="headerlink" title="1.

Great League"></a>1. Great League</h3><p>The Great League is the easiest league to jump into for beginners. Here, only Pokémon with 1,500 CP or less can join the battle. This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.</p><h3 id="2-Ultra-League"><a href="#2-Ultra-League" class="headerlink" title="2. Ultra League"></a>2. Ultra League</h3><p>The next league that comes is Ultra League, which raises the CP cap to 2,500. Legendary Pokémon start making appearances here, with a focus on defensive power. Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.</p><p>In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.</p><h3 id="3-Master-League"><a href="#3-Master-League" class="headerlink" title="3.

Pokémon like Groudon and Origin Forme Giratina are notable here, making them fit for any kind of battle.</p><p>Surprisingly, some Pokémon are not commonly picked for Raids, like Dialga and Altered Forme Giratina.

It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.</p><h3 id="Why-Users-download-iPogo"><a href="#Why-Users-download-iPogo" class="headerlink" title="Why Users download iPogo?"></a>Why Users download iPogo?</h3><p>iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices.

Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;</p><ul><li>The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.</li><li>With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.</li><li>If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.</li><li>You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.</li><li>If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.</li><li>You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.</li></ul><p>With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working.

For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Realme GT Neo 5 SE device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.</p><p>Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.</p><p>Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;</p><ul><li>One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.</li><li>Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.</li><li>Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135372/19272" target="_top" id="2135372">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135372" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135372/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue"><a href="#Some-Easy-Solutions-for-fixing-the-“iPogo-not-working”-issue" class="headerlink" title="Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue"></a>Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue</h3><p>It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.</p><ul><li><strong>Limiting the usage of System Resources:</strong> Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.</li><li><strong>Too many Items opened:</strong> Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.</li><li><strong>Keep you Device Clean:</strong> Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.</li><li><strong>Install the Official Version:</strong> It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.</li></ul><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location"><a href="#Part-2-A-better-alternative-for-iPogo-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location"></a>Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location</h2><p>If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use.

Some players could simply use “charged moves” repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-the-Go-battle-league-known-issues"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-the-Go-battle-league-known-issues" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?"></a>Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?</h2><p>Pokémon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer’s experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.</p><p>Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.</p><p>The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.</p><p>Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.</p><p>Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 1"                ></p><p>Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.</p><p>Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –</strong> Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.</li><li><strong>Fast Attacks are slower on Android –</strong> Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.</li><li><strong>Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -</strong> Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.</li><li><strong>Go Battle wins are not counted –</strong> Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.</li><li><strong>Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball –</strong> A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.</li><li><strong>Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button –</strong> The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pokémon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.</li><li><strong>Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen –</strong> After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‘Next Battle’ option disappears from the Post-win screen.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available"><a href="#Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?"></a>Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?</h2><p>It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.</p><p>Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.</p><p>Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.</p><p>The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.</p><p>After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.</p><p>Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 2"                ></p><p>After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.</p><p>Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.</p><p>Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to. Battle Leagues, since its debut has had 4 seasons till now and trainers are all pumped for Season 5.</p><p>Here’s a list of exciting updates that will be included in the upcoming season;</p><ul><li>At Rank 7 you will encounter a Legendary Pokémon on the Go Battle League battle tracks as similar to the Legendary Pokémon encountered in 5star raids.</li><li>To reach Rank 2 a trainer will need to complete a number of Battles in order to progress.</li><li>From Rank 3 all the way to Rank 10, a higher number of battles must be won to proceed.</li><li>Season 5 will be completed once you reach rank 7 which will earn you the Elite Charged TM rather than an Elite Fast TM.</li><li>In Season 5 few Pokémon’s will get new updated move sets which the trainers can use to train and prepare for upcoming tournaments.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-you-want-to-level-up-your-pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-you-want-to-level-up-your-pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?"></a>Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?</h2><p>The basics you need to learn to play Pokémon go is catching Pokémon and powering them up. Other than that there are ways you can speed power up your Pokémon to increase CP to higher levels. The overall Pokémon’s collected, evolved or powered up, and battles fought in Battle League will win you points to level up in Pokémon Go.</p><p>Although it might seem like a long and hard journey, it doesn’t need to. You can catch and power up Pokémon faster and cover longer distances with some help from WondershareDr.Fone. With smoother and easier GPS spoofing you can cover Poke stops much quicker.</p><p>Here’s some tips you can put to easy use in Levelling Up in Pokémon Go:</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Use-dr-fone-Virtual-Location"><a href="#Tip-1-Use-dr-fone-Virtual-Location" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Use dr.fone Virtual Location"></a>Tip #1: Use dr.fone Virtual Location</h3><p>Use Wondershare <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to easily teleport to catch more poke stops at an adjustable speed and free-hand direction.

The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install:</strong></p><p>Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect:</strong></p><p>Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:</strong></p><p>Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.</p><p>To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the ‘March’ button. You will be required to do the Pokémon Go walking illusion at some point.

It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation.

Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Let’s Go, Eevee!

The three leagues are commonly called the Great League, Ultra League, and Master League. During leagues, there is a certain limit of using the combat power (CP) of Pokémon. Each league requires Pokémon with different CP restrictions and strategies compared with others.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>Pokémon GO PvP</strong> is designed to use an array of Pokémon in a particular league. Notably, you can use only three Pokémon while fighting in a league. Read this article to stay updated about the leagues and achieve the maximum rewards and ranking. By the end, you will also get familiar with the 15 strongest <strong>Pokémon GO PvP</strong> and a robust location spoofer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-strongest-pokemon-in-go-pvp-leagues-1.jpg"                      alt="finding strongest pokemon for pvp league"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Limitations-of-CP-for-Every-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Limitations-of-CP-for-Every-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What Are the Limitations of CP for Every Pokémon GO PvP League</h2><p>For a diverse and challenging gaming experience, <strong>Pokémon GO PvP</strong> comes up with CP limitations. So far, the Great League is easier to start because players with a limit of 1500 CP Pokémon can participate. Then comes the Ultra League, where you’ll find more legendary Pokémon due to its 2500 CP limitation. Unlike other leagues, there is no Pokémon CP limitation in the Master League.</p><p>In addition, these three Pokémon GO leagues often feature themed cups. For instance, Master League Classic is more likely to feature Pokémon with no CP limit but excludes Pokémon powered up with Candy XL and Legendary Pokémon. Anyhow, you can go through the table given below to memorize the CP limit for PvP leagues instantly:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Battle Leagues</strong></th><th><strong>CP Limit</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pokémon GO Great League</strong></td><td>1500 CP Limit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon GO Ultra League</strong></td><td>2500 CP Limit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon GO Master League</strong></td><td>No CP limit</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-2-5-Strongest-Pokemon-for-Pokemon-GO-Great-League"><a href="#Part-2-5-Strongest-Pokemon-for-Pokemon-GO-Great-League" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Strongest Pokémon for Pokémon GO Great League"></a>Part 2. 5 Strongest Pokémon for Pokémon GO Great League</h2><p>Start your Pokémon Go Battle by tapping the Poke Ball and Battle option.

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Install:</strong></p><p>Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Connect:</strong></p><p>Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:</strong></p><p>Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><p>The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>Dr. Fone’s application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.</p><p>To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the ‘March’ button. You will be required to do the Pokémon Go walking illusion at some point. Dr. Fone’s virtual movement imitation application eases your life and lets you do the job without being concerned about travel costs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="virtual location 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-Shiny-Meltan-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-Shiny-Meltan-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pokémon Go?</h2><p>Meltan is a legendary steel-type Pokémon that was initially launched in Pokémon Go. It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let’s Go, Pikachu! or Let’s Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.</p><p>The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-home-vs-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="pokemon home vs pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Pokémon is one of the most enjoyable games, not only because it yields prizes such as the mystery box Pokémon, Meltan Pokémon, shiny Meltan Pokémon go, but it also develops players’ interest completely.

If you own an iOS device, then I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which provides excellent location spoofing solutions.

Just click on the third option (One-stop route) and look for any location from the search bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="walk mode"                ></p><p>Now you can just select the number of times you wish to move and complete other settings, such as enabling the realistic and fluctuation mode. After that, click on the “Move Here” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="confirm marching"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong><br>1. <strong>Realistic Mode:</strong> It enhances the realism of the simulation by fluctuating the speed during the simulation.<br>2. <strong>Fluctuation Mode</strong>: This feature enables you to move around within a 5-meter range after reaching your destination, instead of remaining static. This helps to make the GPS location change more realistic, making it less likely for Pokemon Go to detect the use of the virtual location.</em></p><p>This will just start the simulation, and you can even adjust the speed from a slider at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="start the simulation"                ></p><p><strong><em>Step 3: Move along multiple spots</em></strong></p><p>Using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), you can also simulate an entire route between multiple spots as well. To do this, just click on the “Multi-stop route” which is the fourth option in the top-right corner of the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="route between multiple spots"                ></p><p>Now, you can mark multiple spots on the map and can also select the number of times you wish to take this route.

You can also change your walking speed from a slider as well.</p><p>In this way, you can learn how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking at the convenience of your home!</p><h2 id="Way-2-Use-an-Android-Location-Spoofer"><a href="#Way-2-Use-an-Android-Location-Spoofer" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Use an Android Location Spoofer"></a>Way 2: Use an Android Location Spoofer</h2><p>This is one of the quickest ways to learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking. If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Realme GT Neo 5 SE and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock the Developer Options settings"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go. Do the same a few times to cover a prominent distance.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-4.jpg"                      alt="change your location to a few meters away"                ></p></li></ol><p>Just be sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect that you are using a GPS spoofer to hatch eggs. The regular use of an app like this might result in your account ban.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Fix-Your-Realme-GT-Neo-5-SE-on-a-Drone-and-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-3-Fix-Your-Realme-GT-Neo-5-SE-on-a-Drone-and-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 3: Fix Your Realme GT Neo 5 SE on a Drone and Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 3: Fix Your Realme GT Neo 5 SE on a Drone and Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>Apart from a location spoofing app, there are a handful of other ways to learn how to hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go. Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Realme GT Neo 5 SE service on your Realme GT Neo 5 SE or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile. Adjacent to the “Me” section, tap on the “Friends” section instead.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-6.jpg"                      alt="go to your profile"                ></p></li><li><p>Here, you can see a list of your friends and an option to add more friends on Pokemon Go. To add a friend, you need to enter their code which can be obtained from any dedicated forum or even Reddit.</p></li><li><p>That’s it! Once you have added a friend, go to their profile, and choose to trade or send them a gift. For instance, you can send them an exclusive egg and help them hack eggs without walking.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-7.jpg"                      alt="help friends hack eggs"                ></p></li></ol><p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong></p><p>If you have a friend who goes for a jog or walks a lot, then you can just open Pokemon Go on their phone and let them cover the distance for you as well!</p><h2 id="Way-5-Use-Your-Pokecoins-to-Purchase-More-Incubators"><a href="#Way-5-Use-Your-Pokecoins-to-Purchase-More-Incubators" class="headerlink" title="Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators"></a>Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators</h2><p>You might already know that Pokecoins is the official currency of Pokemon Go. Using it, you can buy all kinds of tools, incense, eggs, incubators, and even Pokemons. Though, if you wish to learn how to hack eggs in Pokemon Go without moving, then consider getting some incubators. There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.</p></li><li><p>From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want. For instance, $0.99 would let you purchase 100 Pokecoins.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-8.jpeg"                      alt="get Pokecoins"                ></p></li><li><p>Great! Once you have enough Pokecoins, go to the Shop again and choose to buy eggs and incubators.</p></li><li><p>After getting enough incubators, you can go to your collection and apply more incubators to hatch eggs without walking.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-9.jpg"                      alt="apply more incubators"                ></p></li></ol><h2 id="Way-6-Make-Use-of-Your-Bike-or-Skateboard"><a href="#Way-6-Make-Use-of-Your-Bike-or-Skateboard" class="headerlink" title="Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard"></a>Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard</h2><p>This is one of the oldest tricks in the book to learn <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong>. You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115948/19272" target="_top" id="2115948">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115948" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="336" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115948/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable? If yes, you are lucky! You can use it that you used to listen to music to trick Pokemon Go that you’re walking and hatch the eggs. Because the turntable creates enough motion in a wide enough circle that it will trick your phone’s internal sensors into thinking you’re walking. This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:</p><p>Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable &gt; Turn on the turntable &gt; Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch. If not, readjust your device and try again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking.jpg"                      alt="play pokemon go with turntable"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Tired of walking to hatch eggs?

Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.</li><li><strong>Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -</strong> Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.</li><li><strong>Go Battle wins are not counted –</strong> Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.</li><li><strong>Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball –</strong> A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.</li><li><strong>Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button –</strong> The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pokémon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.</li><li><strong>Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen –</strong> After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‘Next Battle’ option disappears from the Post-win screen.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available"><a href="#Part-2-Why-does-the-go-battle-not-available" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?"></a>Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?</h2><p>It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.</p><p>Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.</p><p>Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.</p><p>The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.</p><p>After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.</p><p>Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 2"                ></p><p>After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.</p><p>Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.</p><p>Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to.

However, many players have reported encountering the “Failed to detect location (12)” error while playing the game. This error can be frustrating as it prevents players from playing the game properly. In this article, we will discuss what causes the “Failed to detect location (12)” error in Pokemon Go and how you can fix it on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G.</p><p>Pokémon Go has been on the nerves of its players and this is all because of the AR notion that it presents. The failed to detect location 12 is one of the most common errors that are faced by the players while playing this game.

The location analytics of the game has made sure that it becomes the overnight sensation. Three main attributes are associated with the location framework of the game.

The second part is the fact that this map has evolved and there are no shortcuts to its success. Ingress was the previous game that was developed by Niantic and the crowdsourcing of this map started with the evolution of this application. This was developed by the same team that is working on the core of Google Earth.</p><h3 id="ii-Real-World-Gestures"><a href="#ii-Real-World-Gestures" class="headerlink" title="ii. Real World Gestures"></a>ii. Real World Gestures</h3><p>The augmented reality is another important aspect that is related to Pokemon Go and this also means that the location services are relied on when it comes to this application. The android and the iOS location services are continuously used by the game to provide the pinpoint locations as well as the game features that are not found in other applications. The use of location through GPS satellites even becomes more important for such gestures. Especially when the player is outdoors it becomes too important to deal with using GPS location.</p><h3 id="iii-Place-Attribution"><a href="#iii-Place-Attribution" class="headerlink" title="iii. Place Attribution"></a>iii. Place Attribution</h3><p>The system within the system that has been designed by the game developers makes sure that the location inaccuracies are accounted for.

If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times.

Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it!

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Realme 12 Pro+ 5G service on your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts.

You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><h2 id="Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go.

Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable?

If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.</p><h2 id="Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced"><a href="#Part-1-List-of-the-regional-Pokemon-that-have-been-announced" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced"></a>Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced</h2><p>Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.</p><p>These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.</p><p>There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.</p><p>If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.</p><p>List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!</p><p>As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.</p><h3 id="Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-1-Kanto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon"></a>Gen 1&#x2F; Kanto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/kanto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="kanto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Taouros:</strong> North America.</li><li><strong>Farfetch’d:</strong> Asia.</li><li><strong>Mr. Mime:</strong> Europe.</li><li><strong>Kangashkhan:</strong> Australia&#x2F;Pacific.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-2-Johto-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon"></a>Gen 2&#x2F; Johto Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/johto-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="johto pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Heracross:</strong> South America&#x2F; Southern Florida.</li><li><strong>Corsola:</strong> Equatorial Latitudes.</li></ul><h3 id="Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon"><a href="#Gen-3-Hoenn-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon"></a>Gen 3&#x2F; Hoenn Pokémon</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/hoenn-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="hoenn pokemon"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Tropius:</strong> The Middle East and Africa.</li><li><strong>Torkoal:</strong> Southeast Asia.</li><li><strong>Volbeat:</strong> Europe, Australia, and Asia.</li><li><strong>Relicanth:</strong> The Cook Islands&#x2F;New Zealand.</li><li><strong>Solrock:</strong> Currently America and Africa.

Remember that Pokémon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN.

When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.</p><ul><li><strong>Curve Ball:</strong> Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.</li><li><strong>Maximize your Medals:</strong> Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.</li><li><strong>Keep Consistent:</strong> The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.</li><li><strong>Save your Berries:</strong> Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.</li><li><strong>Use Powerful Poke balls:</strong> Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.</li></ul><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.</p><h2 id="Ways-to-trade-pokemon-go-from-far-away-On-Realme-Narzo-N55"><a href="#Ways-to-trade-pokemon-go-from-far-away-On-Realme-Narzo-N55" class="headerlink" title="Ways to trade pokemon go from far away On Realme Narzo N55?"></a>Ways to trade pokemon go from far away On Realme Narzo N55?</h2><p>If you’re a regular Pokemon go player then the title of this article would have truly intrigued you.

This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.</p><h3 id="2-Ultra-League"><a href="#2-Ultra-League" class="headerlink" title="2.

Legendary Pokémon start making appearances here, with a focus on defensive power. Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.</p><p>In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.</p><h3 id="3-Master-League"><a href="#3-Master-League" class="headerlink" title="3. Master League"></a>3. Master League</h3><p>The Master League removes all CP limits, allowing any Pokémon to jump into the action. Here, Trainers tend to lean towards Pokémon with high maximum CP. Pokémon like Groudon and Origin Forme Giratina are notable here, making them fit for any kind of battle.</p><p>Surprisingly, some Pokémon are not commonly picked for Raids, like Dialga and Altered Forme Giratina.

The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo"><a href="#Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?"></a>Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?</h2><p>iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1"                ></p><p>The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.</p><p>Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer"></a>Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2"                ></p><p>It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -</p><h3 id="Any-App-from-the-Apple-App-Store"><a href="#Any-App-from-the-Apple-App-Store" class="headerlink" title="Any App from the Apple App Store"></a>Any App from the Apple App Store</h3><p>If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iOS-App-Store-pic-3"                ></p><h3 id="In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs"><a href="#In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs" class="headerlink" title="In-built spoofing with VPNs"></a>In-built spoofing with VPNs</h3><p>Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.</p><p>The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4"                ></p><p>If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone.

It needs so much walking, and I can’t do that because of my work – as I don’t get too much time to go out. I know so many people who use location spoofers to do it. Can someone tell me <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong>?”</em></p><p>If you are also going through a similar situation with Pokemon Go, then this would be a perfect guide for you. Ideally, to hatch an egg in Pokemon Go, users are supposed to walk a lot. Don’t worry – some smart tricks can help you hatch more eggs without walking. Read on and learn how to hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-1.jpg"                      alt="hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go"                ></p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u8SwzCXW-tc"></iframe><p> <em>Click “Try It Free” to Download Dr.Fone and Hatch Eggs in Pokemon Go Without Walking Now!</em></p><h2 id="Way-1-Use-an-iOS-Location-Spoofer"><a href="#Way-1-Use-an-iOS-Location-Spoofer" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Use an iOS Location Spoofer"></a>Way 1: Use an iOS Location Spoofer</h2><p>An iOS location spoofer is one of the best ways to learn Pokemon Go hatch eggs without walking. If you own an iOS device, then I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which provides excellent location spoofing solutions. With just one click, you can mock your location to anywhere else in the world. Furthermore, you can also simulate your movement between different spots.</p><ul><li>There is a dedicated feature to simulate our walking movement from one spot to another or between multiple spots using it.</li><li>You can enter the number of times you wish to move to and from the specific locations on Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS).</li><li>There is also an option to select your speed – which can make you mock movements like walking, cycling, or driving.</li><li>You can change your locations and movements as many times as you want without the need to jailbreak your device.</li></ul><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo"></iframe><p>To learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), the following steps can be taken.</p><p><strong><em>Step 1: Connect your device and launch the app</em></strong></p><p>Firstly, just connect your iPhone to the application and launch the Wondershare Dr.Fone &gt; Virtual Location feature.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="launch the Dr.Fone"                ></p><p>Just agree to the terms and click on the “Get Started” button to launch the interface of Virtual Location and start Pokemon Go how to hatch eggs at home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="launch Virtual Location"                ></p><p><strong><em>Step 2: Walk between two stops</em></strong></p><p>As the interface would be launched, you can see five different modes in the top-right corner. Just click on the third option (One-stop route) and look for any location from the search bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="walk mode"                ></p><p>Now you can just select the number of times you wish to move and complete other settings, such as enabling the realistic and fluctuation mode. After that, click on the “Move Here” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="confirm marching"                ></p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong><br>1. <strong>Realistic Mode:</strong> It enhances the realism of the simulation by fluctuating the speed during the simulation.<br>2. <strong>Fluctuation Mode</strong>: This feature enables you to move around within a 5-meter range after reaching your destination, instead of remaining static. This helps to make the GPS location change more realistic, making it less likely for Pokemon Go to detect the use of the virtual location.</em></p><p>This will just start the simulation, and you can even adjust the speed from a slider at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="start the simulation"                ></p><p><strong><em>Step 3: Move along multiple spots</em></strong></p><p>Using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), you can also simulate an entire route between multiple spots as well. To do this, just click on the “Multi-stop route” which is the fourth option in the top-right corner of the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="route between multiple spots"                ></p><p>Now, you can mark multiple spots on the map and can also select the number of times you wish to take this route. Click on the “Start Moving” button to start <strong>Pokemon Go hatch eggs without walking</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="start walking"                ></p><p>In the end, your location would be changed as the simulation would make Pokemon Go believe that you are taking the subsequent route. You can also change your walking speed from a slider as well.</p><p>In this way, you can learn how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking at the convenience of your home!</p><h2 id="Way-2-Use-an-Android-Location-Spoofer"><a href="#Way-2-Use-an-Android-Location-Spoofer" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Use an Android Location Spoofer"></a>Way 2: Use an Android Location Spoofer</h2><p>This is one of the quickest ways to learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking. If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Realme 12+ 5G and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock the Developer Options settings"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go. Do the same a few times to cover a prominent distance.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-4.jpg"                      alt="change your location to a few meters away"                ></p></li></ol><p>Just be sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect that you are using a GPS spoofer to hatch eggs. The regular use of an app like this might result in your account ban.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Fix-Your-Realme-12-5G-on-a-Drone-and-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-3-Fix-Your-Realme-12-5G-on-a-Drone-and-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 3: Fix Your Realme 12+ 5G on a Drone and Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 3: Fix Your Realme 12+ 5G on a Drone and Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>Apart from a location spoofing app, there are a handful of other ways to learn how to hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go. Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Realme 12+ 5G service on your Realme 12+ 5G or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile. Adjacent to the “Me” section, tap on the “Friends” section instead.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-6.jpg"                      alt="go to your profile"                ></p></li><li><p>Here, you can see a list of your friends and an option to add more friends on Pokemon Go. To add a friend, you need to enter their code which can be obtained from any dedicated forum or even Reddit.</p></li><li><p>That’s it! Once you have added a friend, go to their profile, and choose to trade or send them a gift. For instance, you can send them an exclusive egg and help them hack eggs without walking.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-7.jpg"                      alt="help friends hack eggs"                ></p></li></ol><p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong></p><p>If you have a friend who goes for a jog or walks a lot, then you can just open Pokemon Go on their phone and let them cover the distance for you as well!</p><h2 id="Way-5-Use-Your-Pokecoins-to-Purchase-More-Incubators"><a href="#Way-5-Use-Your-Pokecoins-to-Purchase-More-Incubators" class="headerlink" title="Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators"></a>Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators</h2><p>You might already know that Pokecoins is the official currency of Pokemon Go. Using it, you can buy all kinds of tools, incense, eggs, incubators, and even Pokemons. Though, if you wish to learn how to hack eggs in Pokemon Go without moving, then consider getting some incubators. There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.</p></li><li><p>From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want. For instance, $0.99 would let you purchase 100 Pokecoins.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-8.jpeg"                      alt="get Pokecoins"                ></p></li><li><p>Great! Once you have enough Pokecoins, go to the Shop again and choose to buy eggs and incubators.</p></li><li><p>After getting enough incubators, you can go to your collection and apply more incubators to hatch eggs without walking.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-9.jpg"                      alt="apply more incubators"                ></p></li></ol><h2 id="Way-6-Make-Use-of-Your-Bike-or-Skateboard"><a href="#Way-6-Make-Use-of-Your-Bike-or-Skateboard" class="headerlink" title="Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard"></a>Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard</h2><p>This is one of the oldest tricks in the book to learn <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong>. You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead.

I have heard of some techniques, but can’t find any reliable Pokémon Go 100 IV map that works!”</em></strong></p><p> As I read this query posted by a Pokémon Go player on Reddit, I realized that a lot of people can encounter this issue. Since getting a 100 IV Pokémon is something that every player wants, I decided to come up with this guide. In this post, I will share some smart tricks that would help you catch a 100 IV Pokémon. Besides that, I will also let you know how to make the most of a <strong>100 IV Pokémon Go map</strong> as well.</p><p><em><strong>Tips:</strong> Are you finding the 100 IV Pokémon Go map?

You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15&#x2F;15&#x2F;15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.</p><ul><li>A Pokémon with 45&#x2F;45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.</li><li>These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.</li></ul><p>Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.</p><p>Yes, you read it right!

Type “4*” in the search bar, and you will see characters with a 4-star rating.

Apart from using a <strong>Pokémon Go 100 IV map</strong>, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg"                      alt="catch 100 iv pokemon"                ></p><ul><li>If you are fortunate, then you can end up <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html" >catching a “lucky” Pokémon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.</li><li>Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.</li><li>Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).</li><li>Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.</li></ul><p>Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg"                      alt="trading increases the chance of perfect ivs"                ></p><ul><li>For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375</li><li>With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744</li><li>When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197</li><li>Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331</li></ul><p>But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118304/7443" target="_top" id="2118304">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118304" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118304/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-The-5-Best-100-IV-Pokemon-Go-Maps-to-Try"><a href="#Part-4-The-5-Best-100-IV-Pokemon-Go-Maps-to-Try" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: The 5 Best 100 IV Pokémon Go Maps to Try"></a>Part 4: The 5 Best 100 IV Pokémon Go Maps to Try</h2><p>Apart from the above-listed tips, you can also use a <strong>100 IV Pokémon Go map</strong> to check the spawning location of these Pokémon.

Developed by Niantic for iOS and Android, this single console game lets us catch all sorts of Pokemons in different areas. Though, to catch Pokemons, users are expected to visit different places and step out. Needless to say, it restricts the scope to <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/pokemon-go/best-pokemon-type.html" >catch Pokemons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and users often look for Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android. This would let you change your location and <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/android-location/" >spoof Pokemon Go on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> pretty easily.</p><p>In this guide, I will teach you how to use reliable Android Pokemon Go spoof apps and the risks related to them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-so-many-people-seek-Pokemon-Go-spoofing-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Why-so-many-people-seek-Pokemon-Go-spoofing-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?"></a>Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?</h2><p>Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.</p><p>If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020"><a href="#Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020"></a>Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020</h2><p>A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android’s features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.</p><ul><li>If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won’t sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.</li><li>The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.</li><li>The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go spoofing risks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing"></a>Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing</h2><p>As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let’s explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.</p><h3 id="3-1-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#3-1-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Use a VPN"></a>3.1 Use a VPN</h3><p>A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.</p><p>Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here’s how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Pokemon Go on your Realme 10T 5G and create your account if you haven’t already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can’t detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme 10T 5G device again and access the new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg"                      alt="vpn for android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123737/7443" target="_top" id="2123737">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123737" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123737/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go"><a href="#3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Use Fake GPS Go"></a>3.2 Use Fake GPS Go</h3><p>If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme 10T 5G device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme 10T 5G and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; System &gt; About Phone and tap on the “Build Number” option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Realme 10T 5G device’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg"                      alt="select Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> That’s it! Once Fake GPS Go has the needed access, you can just launch the application and manually change your location. Afterward, launch Pokemon Go to access your new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg"                      alt="launch Pokemon Go"                ></p><p>If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won’t detect its presence. Don’t worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.</p><h3 id="3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free"><a href="#3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Use Fake GPS Free"></a>3.3 Use Fake GPS Free</h3><p>This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won’t access a lot of device usage as well.

It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.</p><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.</p><p>The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.</p><p>The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work"><a href="#Part-2-Does-the-master-ball-cheat-code-still-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?"></a>Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?</h2><p>The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.</p><p>The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.</p><p><strong>958D8046<br>A7151D70<br>8BB602F7<br>8CEB681A.</strong></p><p>All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.</p><p>If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.</p><p>You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.</p><p>When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:<br><strong>82005274 0001</strong></p><p>You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”.

By playing Pokemon Go with your friends, you can create teams, participate in raids, and do so much more. Though, the best way to make new friends in the game is by joining an active Pokemon Go Discord server. The good news is that Discord has tons of international and local Pokemon Go servers that you can join. Find out how to find the most appropriate Pokemon Go Discord servers in this guide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/find-pokemon-go-discord-servers-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Discord Servers"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Where-can-I-find-the-Best-Pokemon-Go-Discord-Servers"><a href="#Part-1-Where-can-I-find-the-Best-Pokemon-Go-Discord-Servers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Where can I find the Best Pokemon Go Discord Servers?"></a><strong>Part 1: Where can I find the Best Pokemon Go Discord Servers?</strong></h2><p>Ideally, there are hundreds of Discord servers dedicated to Pokemon Go that you can find. Since it is not possible to join so many servers, I would recommend considering the following options to pick some appropriate Pokemon Discord servers.</p><ol><li><strong>The Silph Road</strong></li></ol><p>The Silph Road has to be the biggest user-driven community that is dedicated to Pokemon Go out there. Apart from Pokemon spawning locations and other secrets, you can also use it to find a Pokemon Go Discord server near you.</p><p>Just go to its website to access the map of various Pokemon Go Discord servers. You can zoom in&#x2F;out the map and even move the pin around to find various servers.</p><p><em>Website:</em> <a href="https://thesilphroad.com/map#2/"><em>https://thesilphroad.com/map#2/</em></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/find-pokemon-go-discord-servers-2.jpg"                      alt="The Silph Road Discord Servers"                ></p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Discord Servers</strong></li></ol><p>As the name suggests, this is one of the biggest directories of Discord servers worldwide. Once you visit the website of Discord Servers, just enter relevant keywords on the search bar. For instance, you can enter “Pokemon Go” and simply get relevant results for Pokemon Go Discord servers. Apart from that, you can also check details about the server and know how active it is.</p><p><em>Website:</em> <a href="https://discordservers.com/search/Pokemon%20Go"><em>https://discordservers.com/search/Pokemon%20Go</em></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/find-pokemon-go-discord-servers-3.jpg"                      alt="Discord Servers Directory"                ></p><ol start="3"><li><strong>DisBoard</strong></li></ol><p>DisBoard is another popular Discord server directory that you can consider exploring. Just enter “Pokemon Go” on the search bar and get a list of various public Discord servers related to the game. Besides that, you can also select different tags to find location-specific Discord Pokemon servers.</p><p><em>Website:</em> <a href="https://disboard.org/servers/tag/pokemon-go"><em>https://disboard.org/servers/tag/pokemon-go</em></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/find-pokemon-go-discord-servers-4.jpg"                      alt="DisBoard Discord Servers"                ></p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Other Places to find Discord Servers</strong></li></ol><p>Just like DisBoard, you can also explore several other websites and Discord server directories to find appropriate Pokemon Go Discord servers. A lot of gamers also explore social networks like Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, Instagram, etc. to find all kinds of Pokemon Discord servers.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Join-a-Pokemon-Go-Discord-Server"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Join-a-Pokemon-Go-Discord-Server" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Join a Pokemon Go Discord Server?"></a><strong>Part 2: How to Join a Pokemon Go Discord Server?</strong></h2><p>By exploring the above-listed options, you would be able to find all kinds of Pokemon Go Discord Servers.

Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p><p>  To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration"                ></p></li><li><p>Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices</p><p>  To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.</p></li><li><p>The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down</p><p>  Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.</p></li></ul><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs.

It is an augmented reality game that allows players to catch Pokemon in the real world using their smartphones. However, many players have reported encountering the “Failed to detect location (12)” error while playing the game. This error can be frustrating as it prevents players from playing the game properly. In this article, we will discuss what causes the “Failed to detect location (12)” error in Pokemon Go and how you can fix it on your Realme 12+ 5G.</p><p>Pokémon Go has been on the nerves of its players and this is all because of the AR notion that it presents. The failed to detect location 12 is one of the most common errors that are faced by the players while playing this game. You might not believe but the GPS signals and the location settings on iPhone or Android are the two main reasons for this error. It can be resolved with ease and this article has been written to get the work done with ease. Applying the methods explained will ensure that you get the best results overall.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-is-Location-Important-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-1-Why-is-Location-Important-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why is Location Important in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 1: Why is Location Important in Pokémon Go?</h2><p>The best part of this game is that it has been compiled keeping in view the location mechanics. The location analytics of the game has made sure that it becomes the overnight sensation. Three main attributes are associated with the location framework of the game. These attributes also show how important the location is for the game. Understanding these attributes will also make sure that the user can overcome the errors such as failed to detect location 12 GPS joystick 2019.</p><h3 id="i-Physical-World-Attribute"><a href="#i-Physical-World-Attribute" class="headerlink" title="i.

The second part is the fact that this map has evolved and there are no shortcuts to its success. Ingress was the previous game that was developed by Niantic and the crowdsourcing of this map started with the evolution of this application. This was developed by the same team that is working on the core of Google Earth.</p><h3 id="ii-Real-World-Gestures"><a href="#ii-Real-World-Gestures" class="headerlink" title="ii. Real World Gestures"></a>ii. Real World Gestures</h3><p>The augmented reality is another important aspect that is related to Pokemon Go and this also means that the location services are relied on when it comes to this application. The android and the iOS location services are continuously used by the game to provide the pinpoint locations as well as the game features that are not found in other applications. The use of location through GPS satellites even becomes more important for such gestures. Especially when the player is outdoors it becomes too important to deal with using GPS location.</p><h3 id="iii-Place-Attribution"><a href="#iii-Place-Attribution" class="headerlink" title="iii. Place Attribution"></a>iii. Place Attribution</h3><p>The system within the system that has been designed by the game developers makes sure that the location inaccuracies are accounted for.

The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader.

The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills.

There are three different types of rewards that you can win when it comes to trainer battles. These are as follows:</p><ul><li>Stardust</li><li>As of January 2019, the Rare Candy reward has also been introduced to make the battles more enchanting.</li><li>1 in 7 chance of Sinnoh Stone.</li></ul><p>No matter that you win or lose a battle these rewards are credited to your account. If you are playing with a computer the threshold to get the rewards is 1. If you are competing with the other players then the rewards can be earned thrice per day. Both the participants will get the same rewards but the abilities are different depending on the fact that whether you are a winner or loser. The Ace trainer medal and its acquaintance will also get the level up with each battle that you win. The other three medals will also get a level up as per a blog post from Niantic.

The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles"><a href="#Part-4-Tips-to-level-up-Pokemon-before-doing-the-Pokemon-go-trainer-battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles"></a>Part 4: Tips to level up Pokémon before doing the Pokémon go trainer battles</h2><p>To get the best out of Pokémon Go battle another trainer it is advised to get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr. Fone Virtual Location <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.</p><p>If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android.

Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let’s explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.</p><h3 id="3-1-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#3-1-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Use a VPN"></a>3.1 Use a VPN</h3><p>A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.</p><p>Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here’s how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Pokemon Go on your Realme 12+ 5G and create your account if you haven’t already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can’t detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme 12+ 5G device again and access the new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg"                      alt="vpn for android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115917/19272" target="_top" id="2115917">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115917" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115917/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go"><a href="#3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Use Fake GPS Go"></a>3.2 Use Fake GPS Go</h3><p>If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme 12+ 5G device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme 12+ 5G and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; System &gt; About Phone and tap on the “Build Number” option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Realme 12+ 5G device’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg"                      alt="select Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> That’s it! Once Fake GPS Go has the needed access, you can just launch the application and manually change your location. Afterward, launch Pokemon Go to access your new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg"                      alt="launch Pokemon Go"                ></p><p>If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won’t detect its presence. Don’t worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.</p><h3 id="3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free"><a href="#3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Use Fake GPS Free"></a>3.3 Use Fake GPS Free</h3><p>This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won’t access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your device’s settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once the app is installed, go to Settings &gt; Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg"                      alt="grant Fake GPS access"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location. You can also manually zoom in or out the map to mark your new location.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-8.jpg"                      alt="Close the GPS app"                ></p><h3 id="The-final-words"><a href="#The-final-words" class="headerlink" title="The final words"></a>The final words</h3><p>There you go!

Ideally, you can partake in a Pokemon PvP battle locally or remotely. It is a 3 vs. 3 battle in which you have to select your best Pokemons to fight with other trainers. To help you become a PvP Poke master, I have come up with this detailed guide that will certainly come in handy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-pvp-battle-tips-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battle tips banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>If you want to be good at the Pokemon Go PvP battles, then you must understand how the game works. Once you are ready, I would recommend some of these Pokemon PvP strategies that are followed by pro players.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues"><a href="#Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Start from the low leagues"></a>Tip 1: Start from the low leagues</h3><p>As you know, there are three different leagues to participate in Pokemon Go PvP battles. If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Great League:</strong> Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Ultra League:</strong> Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Master League:</strong> No CP limit</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="leagues in pokemon pvp"                ></p><p>The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons. The Great League is the best category to learn and try different Pokemon combinations.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves"><a href="#Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves"></a>Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves</h3><p>Ideally, there are four different moves in any PvP Poke battle that you must master. The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.</p><ul><li><strong>Fast attacks:</strong> These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.</li><li><strong>Charge attack:</strong> Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.</li><li><strong>Shield:</strong> This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.</li><li><strong>Swapping:</strong> Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons"><a href="#Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons"></a>Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons</h3><p>This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/opponent-screen-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="opponent screen pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta"><a href="#Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Know the current Meta"></a>Tip 4: Know the current Meta</h3><p>In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.</p><p>There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy"><a href="#Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy"></a>Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy</h3><p>This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.</p><p>Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves"><a href="#Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves"></a>Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves</h3><p>To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.</p><p>During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/fast-moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="fast moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap"><a href="#Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap"></a>Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap</h3><p>This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.</p><p>In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP"><a href="#Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?"></a>Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?</h2><p>Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.</p><ul><li>The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.</li><li>Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.</li><li>Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.</li><li>The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.</li><li>The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-iv-level-trick-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="cp iv level trick pokemon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?"></a>Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?</h2><p>During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Team composition</strong></li></ul><p>Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.</p><ul><li><strong>Focus on attacks</strong></li></ul><p>Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles.

This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong></li></ul><p>You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.</p><ul><li><strong>Switching</strong></li></ul><p>Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle.

When you’re playing with other users, you can earn Stardust based on the number of your previous wins, your game level, and the PVP outcome.</p><p>For instance, if you’re a Rank 2, you can earn around 2,000 Stardust points by winning a battle, and if you’re Rank 24, the number increases to about 200,000. You can also use a Star Piece to multiply your winnings by 1.5.</p><p>Another method is to play with your friends, and the Stardust points can vary from 300 to 1000, depending on your opponent’s rank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-3.jpg"                      alt="pvp in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Opening-Gifts"><a href="#By-Opening-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="By Opening Gifts"></a>By Opening Gifts</h3><p>Opening gifts is one of the main components of the Pokemon Go experience. You’ll get daily gifts you can open for free, earn valuable items, and support your gameplay. Each gift can carry a certain amount of Stardust particles, so you don’t have to do anything to accumulate these items.</p><p>The maximum Stardust you can get in one gift is 300, which may not seem like a lot. However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-4.jpg"                      alt="opening gifts in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Hatching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Hatching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Hatching Pokemon"></a>By Hatching Pokemon</h3><p>Hatching a Pokemon is also one of the essential parts of your Pokemon experience. Every time you hatch an egg, you’ll get Stardust points you can spend on numerous instances. The Stardust amount will depend on the egg itself; the higher the rank, the better the prices.</p><p>You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:</p><ul><li>400–800 Stardust for hatching a 2km egg;</li><li>600–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 5km egg;</li><li>800–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 7km egg;</li><li>1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;</li><li>3200–6400 Stardust for hatching a 12km egg.</li></ul><p>You can also use the Star Piece item to multiply the Stardust amount by 1.5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg"                      alt="eggs in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Catching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Catching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Catching Pokemon"></a>By Catching Pokemon</h3><p>Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.</p><p>Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.</p><p>If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day.

However, you should consider the bright side and fight to earn valuable rewards, such as Stardust points.</p><p>Once you and your team defeat the Boss, you can collect the prizes. You’ll win 1,000 Stardust points each time a Boss enters, even if it leaves the Gym without a fight.</p><p>If you defeat the boss, you’ll also get a chance to catch the Pokemon, which can bring you even more Stardust points!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-7.jpg"                      alt="a raid battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards"><a href="#By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Getting Rocket Rewards"></a>By Getting Rocket Rewards</h3><p>Rocket rewards are sets of items you get after fighting the Team Go Rocket.

Once you enter the app, you can complete these daily tasks for Stardust points.</p><p>The amount of points you will win depends on the task’s difficulty and duration.

Unlock with Candy and Stardust— wreak massive damage, building a team of three starters is more than feasible.</li><li>Togekiss or cute team is one of the brilliant teams in the Pokemon Go ultra league meta to proceed with the game.</li></ul><p>No doubt, such teams will struggle somewhat against steel-types, such as Escavalier. You have a lot of play against everything else. Think about the excellent strategy that when applied, meet the targets.</p><p>Your team is in your hands, be wise before hitting the battle. You might need help to pick the best Pokemon along with knowing why.</p><p>Read on to learn more-</p><p>Well, it can be tempting to put your highest rated Pokemon into the ultra League Pokemon Go because the higher CP describes the mighty strength. Right? So, even with a few of the below Pokemon in your team, you should be able to fare battle while you select those as near to the 2500 CP as possible.</p><p>Here you go-</p><h3 id="1-Venusaur"><a href="#1-Venusaur" class="headerlink" title="1.

The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo"><a href="#Part-1-Why-am-I-unable-to-download-iSpoofer-for-Pogo" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?"></a>Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?</h2><p>iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1"                ></p><p>The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.</p><p>Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Find-other-alternatives-for-the-iSpoofer" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer"></a>Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg"                      alt="iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2"                ></p><p>It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -</p><h3 id="Any-App-from-the-Apple-App-Store"><a href="#Any-App-from-the-Apple-App-Store" class="headerlink" title="Any App from the Apple App Store"></a>Any App from the Apple App Store</h3><p>If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg"                      alt="iOS-App-Store-pic-3"                ></p><h3 id="In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs"><a href="#In-built-spoofing-with-VPNs" class="headerlink" title="In-built spoofing with VPNs"></a>In-built spoofing with VPNs</h3><p>Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.</p><p>The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg"                      alt="VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4"                ></p><p>If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.</p><p>Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account.

Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events"></a>Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events</h2><p>While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.</p><p>The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon"></a>Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon</h2><p>As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.</p><p>However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.</p><p>Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/new-discover-your-latest-fb-watch-list/"><u>[New] Discover Your Latest FB Watch List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-2023-how-to-make-facebook-videos-full-screen/"><u>[New] In 2024, 2023 | How to Make Facebook Videos Full Screen?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-mastering-your-ifunny-meme-journey/"><u>[New] Mastering Your iFunny Meme Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/guida-passo-passo-alla-libera-acquisizione-del-convertitore-videoclip-freemaker-su-un-computer-apple/"><u>Guida Passo-Passo Alla Libera Acquisizione Del Convertitore Videoclip FreeMaker Su Un Computer Apple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-can-i-get-more-stardust-in-pokemon-go-on-realme-c51-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How can I get more stardust in pokemon go On Realme C51? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-detailed-guide-of-ispoofer-for-pogo-installation-on-realme-narzo-60-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Detailed guide of ispoofer for pogo installation On Realme Narzo 60 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-translation.techidaily.com/new-top-7-video-language-converter-online-free-for-2024/"><u>New Top 7 Video Language Converter Online Free for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/pokemon-go-error-12-failed-to-detect-location-on-honor-90-gt-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Pokemon Go Error 12 Failed to Detect Location On Honor 90 GT? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/pokemon-go-no-gps-signal-heres-every-possible-solution-on-realme-11-proplus-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Pokemon Go No GPS Signal?
