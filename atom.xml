To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let’s explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.</p><h3 id="3-1-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#3-1-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Use a VPN"></a>3.1 Use a VPN</h3><p>A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.</p><p>Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here’s how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Pokemon Go on your Realme 12+ 5G and create your account if you haven’t already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can’t detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme 12+ 5G device again and access the new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg"                      alt="vpn for android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118311/7443" target="_top" id="2118311">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118311" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118311/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go"><a href="#3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Use Fake GPS Go"></a>3.2 Use Fake GPS Go</h3><p>If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme 12+ 5G device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme 12+ 5G and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; System &gt; About Phone and tap on the “Build Number” option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Realme 12+ 5G device’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg"                      alt="select Fake GPS Go"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> That’s it! Once Fake GPS Go has the needed access, you can just launch the application and manually change your location. Afterward, launch Pokemon Go to access your new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg"                      alt="launch Pokemon Go"                ></p><p>If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won’t detect its presence. Don’t worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.</p><h3 id="3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free"><a href="#3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Use Fake GPS Free"></a>3.3 Use Fake GPS Free</h3><p>This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won’t access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your device’s settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once the app is installed, go to Settings &gt; Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg"                      alt="grant Fake GPS access"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136623/26400" target="_top" id="2136623">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136623" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136623/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location.

For instance, you have to walk around the street to catch as many Pokemon as possible. Another thing is that you need to visit the physical location of the PokeStops to spin the Photo Disc. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use mobile devices when streaming Pokemon Go adventures. Don’t fret. Most modern smartphones nowadays are capable of handling such demanding tasks. Do you want to try it now?

You can actually go live under natural daylight and document your adventure as it is. However, keep in mind that you’re simultaneously doing two different tasks in this regard.

Completing your Pokedex requires a lot of traveling to specific parts of the globe, trading with players who have been there, or waiting for Pokemon GO’s special events.</p><p>Alternatively, players can use virtual location-changing tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone, and today, we’ll show you how to catch all <strong>Pokemon GO regional exclusives</strong> with this easy-to-use app.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution</h2><p>With almost 60 Pokemon GO regional exclusives in 2024, keeping track of where each creature spawns can be a nightmare, especially when some Pokemon can only be found in tiny and specific areas. However, you don’t necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.</p><h3 id="Getting-Information-From-the-Community"><a href="#Getting-Information-From-the-Community" class="headerlink" title="Getting Information From the Community"></a>Getting Information From the Community</h3><p>The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community.

Wondershare Dr.Fone is a fantastic example of such a tool, and with a quick setup and a few clicks, it can help players move without moving.</p><p>Using Dr.Fone to change your virtual location is remarkably straightforward and can be done in a few steps.

Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events"></a>Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events</h2><p>While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.</p><p>The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.</p><h2 id="Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon"><a href="#Part-7-Trading-Regional-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon"></a>Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon</h2><p>As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.</p><p>However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.</p><p>Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-finest-9-digital-places-for-harvesting-futuristic-3d-typefaces/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Finest 9 Digital Places for Harvesting Futuristic 3D Typefaces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-virtual-space-insights-into-vr-cinema/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering Virtual Space Insights Into VR Cinema</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/catchemall-celebrate-national-pokemon-day-with-virtual-location-on-honor-magic-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>CatchEmAll Celebrate National Pokémon Day with Virtual Location On Honor Magic 6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/expert-advice-on-reducing-dota-2-lag-for-a-seamless-experience/"><u>Expert Advice on Reducing Dota 2 Lag for a Seamless Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-tecno-spark-20-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Stop My Spouse from Spying on My Tecno Spark 20 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/how-to-use-pokemon-emerald-master-ball-cheat-on-nubia-z50s-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Use Pokémon Emerald Master Ball Cheat On Nubia Z50S Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-file-download-voice-track-analysis/"><u>In 2024, File Download Voice Track Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-realme-gt-5-240w-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Realme GT 5 (240W)? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/leading-setups-in-professional-broadcast-equipment-for-2024/"><u>Leading Setups in Professional Broadcast Equipment for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-get-the-rare-candy-on-pokemon-go-fire-red-on-realme-c33-2023-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Realme C33 2023 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/unova-stone-pokemon-go-evolution-list-and-how-catch-them-for-realme-gt-5-240w-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Unova Stone Pokémon Go Evolution List and How Catch Them For Realme GT 5 (240W) | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-Come-up-With-the-Best-Pokemon-Team-On-Realme-12-5G"><a href="#How-to-Come-up-With-the-Best-Pokemon-Team-On-Realme-12-5G" class="headerlink" title="How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Realme 12+ 5G?"></a>How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Realme 12+ 5G?</h2><p>If you have been playing Pokemon games (like Sun&#x2F;Moon or Sword&#x2F;Shield), then you must be familiar with their team building. To succeed, players are encouraged to create teams of their Pokemons that they have to use to complete missions. Though, it might take a while to master how you create a winning team. To help you, I have come up with some smart tips that would let you come up with some amazing Pokemon teams.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Team Building Banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-are-Some-Good-Pokemon-Team-Examples"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-Some-Good-Pokemon-Team-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What are Some Good Pokemon Team Examples?"></a>Part 1: What are Some Good Pokemon Team Examples?</h2><p>To understand the dynamics of team composition, you should know that there are ideally different kinds of Pokemons:</p><ul><li>Sweeper: These Pokemons are mostly used to attack as they can do a lot of damage and even move swiftly. Though, they have low defense stats and can be of a physical or special type.</li><li>Tanker: These Pokemons have high defense stats and can take a lot of damage. Though, they have slow movement and low attacking stats.</li><li>Annoyer: They are known for their fast movement and while their damage might not be so high, they can annoy your opponents.</li><li>Cleric: These are supportive Pokemons that are mostly used to heal or boost the stats of other Pokemons.</li><li>Drainer: These are also supportive Pokemons, but they can drain the stats of your opponents while healing your team.</li><li>Wall: These are tougher than tank Pokemons and can take a substantial amount of damage from sweepers.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-4.jpg"                      alt="hola free vpn"                ></p><p>Based on these different types of Pokemons, you can come up with the following teams to win your next battle:</p><h3 id="1-2x-Physical-Sweeper-2x-Special-Sweeper-Tanker-and-Annoyer"><a href="#1-2x-Physical-Sweeper-2x-Special-Sweeper-Tanker-and-Annoyer" class="headerlink" title="1. 2x Physical Sweeper, 2x Special Sweeper, Tanker, and Annoyer"></a>1. 2x Physical Sweeper, 2x Special Sweeper, Tanker, and Annoyer</h3><p>If you want to have an attacking team, then this would be the perfect combination. While the annoyer and tanker would drain the HP of the opponents, your sweeper Pokemons can finish them with their high attacking stats.</p><h3 id="2-3x-Sweepers-Physical-Special-Mixed-Tanker-Wall-and-Annoyer"><a href="#2-3x-Sweepers-Physical-Special-Mixed-Tanker-Wall-and-Annoyer" class="headerlink" title="2. 3x Sweepers (Physical&#x2F;Special&#x2F;Mixed), Tanker, Wall, and Annoyer"></a>2. 3x Sweepers (Physical&#x2F;Special&#x2F;Mixed), Tanker, Wall, and Annoyer</h3><p>This is one of the most balanced Pokemon teams that would work in almost every situation. In this, we have a tanker and a wall to take damage from the opponent’s Pokemon. Also, we have three different types of sweepers to do maximum damage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-3.jpg"                      alt="Balanced Pokemon Teams"                ></p><h3 id="3-Drainer-Tanker-Cleric-and-3-Sweepers-Physical-Special-Mixed"><a href="#3-Drainer-Tanker-Cleric-and-3-Sweepers-Physical-Special-Mixed" class="headerlink" title="3. Drainer, Tanker, Cleric, and 3 Sweepers (Physical&#x2F;Special&#x2F;Mixed)"></a>3. Drainer, Tanker, Cleric, and 3 Sweepers (Physical&#x2F;Special&#x2F;Mixed)</h3><p>In some situations (when there are lots of sweepers in the opponent’s team), this team would excel. Your support Pokemons (drainers and clerics) would boost the HP of sweepers while the tanker would take the damage.</p><h3 id="4-Rayquaza-Arceus-Dialga-Kyogre-Palkia-and-Groudon"><a href="#4-Rayquaza-Arceus-Dialga-Kyogre-Palkia-and-Groudon" class="headerlink" title="4. Rayquaza, Arceus, Dialga, Kyogre, Palkia, and Groudon"></a>4. Rayquaza, Arceus, Dialga, Kyogre, Palkia, and Groudon</h3><p>This is one of the most legendary teams in Pokemon that any player can have. The only issue is catching these legendary Pokemons can take a lot of time and effort, but it would certainly be worth it.</p><h3 id="5-Garchomp-Decidueye-Salazzle-Araquanid-Metagross-and-Weavile"><a href="#5-Garchomp-Decidueye-Salazzle-Araquanid-Metagross-and-Weavile" class="headerlink" title="5. Garchomp, Decidueye, Salazzle, Araquanid, Metagross, and Weavile"></a>5. Garchomp, Decidueye, Salazzle, Araquanid, Metagross, and Weavile</h3><p>Even if you don’t have a lot of experience in the game, you can try this power-packed team in Pokemon games like Sun and Moon. It has the perfect balance of attacking and defensive Pokemons that would excel in every situation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-4.jpg"                      alt="Attacking Pokemon Teams"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Things-to-Consider-while-Creating-your-Pokemon-Team"><a href="#Part-2-Things-to-Consider-while-Creating-your-Pokemon-Team" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Things to Consider while Creating your Pokemon Team"></a>Part 2: Things to Consider while Creating your Pokemon Team</h2><p>Since there could be so many ways for coming up with a Pokemon team, I would recommend following these suggestions:</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Consider-your-strategy"><a href="#Tip-1-Consider-your-strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Consider your strategy"></a>Tip 1: Consider your strategy</h3><p>The most important thing that you need to know is the overall strategy that you have to focus on game. For instance, at times, players would like to play defensively while others want to focus on attacking.

After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:</p><ul><li><p>Stay Safe Indoors</p><p>  Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.</p></li><li><p>Move Beyond your Area</p><p>  If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons.

At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.</p><p>  <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go Account Ban"                ></p><p>  To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”.

Best Ways to Get Stardust in Pokemon Go</h2><p>Since having Stardust is crucial for your Pokemon Go experience, you may be looking for the best ways to accumulate as many consumables as possible. We’ll present a couple of ways to reach your goals below.</p><h3 id="Through-Pvp-Rewards"><a href="#Through-Pvp-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="Through Pvp Rewards"></a>Through Pvp Rewards</h3><p>One of the best ways to earn Stardust is through Player versus Player features. When you’re playing with other users, you can earn Stardust based on the number of your previous wins, your game level, and the PVP outcome.</p><p>For instance, if you’re a Rank 2, you can earn around 2,000 Stardust points by winning a battle, and if you’re Rank 24, the number increases to about 200,000. You can also use a Star Piece to multiply your winnings by 1.5.</p><p>Another method is to play with your friends, and the Stardust points can vary from 300 to 1000, depending on your opponent’s rank.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-3.jpg"                      alt="pvp in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Opening-Gifts"><a href="#By-Opening-Gifts" class="headerlink" title="By Opening Gifts"></a>By Opening Gifts</h3><p>Opening gifts is one of the main components of the Pokemon Go experience. You’ll get daily gifts you can open for free, earn valuable items, and support your gameplay. Each gift can carry a certain amount of Stardust particles, so you don’t have to do anything to accumulate these items.</p><p>The maximum Stardust you can get in one gift is 300, which may not seem like a lot. However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-4.jpg"                      alt="opening gifts in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Hatching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Hatching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Hatching Pokemon"></a>By Hatching Pokemon</h3><p>Hatching a Pokemon is also one of the essential parts of your Pokemon experience. Every time you hatch an egg, you’ll get Stardust points you can spend on numerous instances. The Stardust amount will depend on the egg itself; the higher the rank, the better the prices.</p><p>You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:</p><ul><li>400–800 Stardust for hatching a 2km egg;</li><li>600–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 5km egg;</li><li>800–1,600 Stardust for hatching a 7km egg;</li><li>1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;</li><li>3200–6400 Stardust for hatching a 12km egg.</li></ul><p>You can also use the Star Piece item to multiply the Stardust amount by 1.5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg"                      alt="eggs in pokemon go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080333/19272" target="_top" id="2080333">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080333" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080333/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="By-Catching-Pokemon"><a href="#By-Catching-Pokemon" class="headerlink" title="By Catching Pokemon"></a>By Catching Pokemon</h3><p>Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.</p><p>Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.</p><p>If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-6.jpg"                      alt="catch a pokemon"                ></p><h3 id="By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards"><a href="#By-Claiming-Raid-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Claiming Raid Rewards"></a>By Claiming Raid Rewards</h3><p>When the Boss enters your Gym, you may think it’s a stressful scenario. However, you should consider the bright side and fight to earn valuable rewards, such as Stardust points.</p><p>Once you and your team defeat the Boss, you can collect the prizes. You’ll win 1,000 Stardust points each time a Boss enters, even if it leaves the Gym without a fight.</p><p>If you defeat the boss, you’ll also get a chance to catch the Pokemon, which can bring you even more Stardust points!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-7.jpg"                      alt="a raid battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards"><a href="#By-Getting-Rocket-Rewards" class="headerlink" title="By Getting Rocket Rewards"></a>By Getting Rocket Rewards</h3><p>Rocket rewards are sets of items you get after fighting the Team Go Rocket. Each time you beat this criminal group, you’ll be rewarded with either 500 or 1,000 Stardust points, depending on whether you were fighting Grunt or Team Go Leader.</p><p>Additionally, if you ever face Giovanni, you’ll get 5,000 points for fighting and beating him.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-8.jpg"                      alt="rocket battle in pokemon go"                ></p><h3 id="By-Earning-Research-Rewards-Through-Completed-Tasks"><a href="#By-Earning-Research-Rewards-Through-Completed-Tasks" class="headerlink" title="By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks"></a>By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks</h3><p>Each player will get their daily to-do list depending on their skill and game level. Once you enter the app, you can complete these daily tasks for Stardust points.</p><p>The amount of points you will win depends on the task’s difficulty and duration. However, you should complete all the daily tasks to accumulate as many consumables as possible.</p><p>For instance, if you’re on level 45, you can head to the Go Battle League 45 times to earn 4,500 Stardust points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-9.jpg"                      alt="pokemon go research tasks"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100533/7443" target="_top" id="2100533">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100533" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100533/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="By-Visiting-the-Gym"><a href="#By-Visiting-the-Gym" class="headerlink" title="By Visiting the Gym"></a>By Visiting the Gym</h3><p>While on your daily walk in the Pokemon world, you should check out whether you can find some Gyms around you. If you do, stop by to hang around with some of the most precious Pokemon characters and give them a berry while you’re there.</p><p>You’ll earn 20 Stardust points for each berry you give a Pokemon. It may be the easiest way to earn and use these points for your experience. Plus, you’ll meet new characters and fully experience what the Pokemon world offers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-10.jpg"                      alt="giving berries to pokemon characters"                ></p><h3 id="Claim-Stardust-Quickly-in-Pokemon-Go-by-Using-Location-Spoofing"><a href="#Claim-Stardust-Quickly-in-Pokemon-Go-by-Using-Location-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Claim Stardust Quickly in Pokemon Go by Using Location Spoofing"></a>Claim Stardust Quickly in Pokemon Go by Using Location Spoofing</h3><p>If you live in a rural area and don’t get too many chances to walk around and catch Pokemon characters, you can use a classic trick of location spoofing. It will allow you to change your virtual location and wander the streets of another city to discover more Pokemon opportunities.</p><p>However, you’ll need a reliable tool to realize your Pokemon goals.

Developed by Niantic for iOS and Android, this single console game lets us catch all sorts of Pokemons in different areas. Though, to catch Pokemons, users are expected to visit different places and step out. Needless to say, it restricts the scope to <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/pokemon-go/best-pokemon-type.html" >catch Pokemons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and users often look for Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android. This would let you change your location and <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/android-location/" >spoof Pokemon Go on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> pretty easily.</p><p>In this guide, I will teach you how to use reliable Android Pokemon Go spoof apps and the risks related to them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-so-many-people-seek-Pokemon-Go-spoofing-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Why-so-many-people-seek-Pokemon-Go-spoofing-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?"></a>Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?</h2><p>Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.</p><p>If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020"><a href="#Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020"></a>Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020</h2><p>A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android’s features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.</p><ul><li>If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won’t sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.</li><li>The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.</li><li>The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go spoofing risks"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993647%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing"></a>Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing</h2><p>As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let’s explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.</p><h3 id="3-1-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#3-1-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Use a VPN"></a>3.1 Use a VPN</h3><p>A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.</p><p>Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here’s how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Pokemon Go on your Realme 12+ 5G and create your account if you haven’t already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can’t detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme 12+ 5G device again and access the new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg"                      alt="vpn for android"                ></p><h3 id="3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go"><a href="#3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Use Fake GPS Go"></a>3.2 Use Fake GPS Go</h3><p>If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme 12+ 5G device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme 12+ 5G and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your phone’s Settings &gt; System &gt; About Phone and tap on the “Build Number” option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg"                      alt="Fake GPS Go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Realme 12+ 5G device’s Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device’s location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg"                      alt="select Fake GPS Go"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> That’s it! Once Fake GPS Go has the needed access, you can just launch the application and manually change your location. Afterward, launch Pokemon Go to access your new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg"                      alt="launch Pokemon Go"                ></p><p>If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won’t detect its presence. Don’t worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.</p><h3 id="3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free"><a href="#3-3-Use-Fake-GPS-Free" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Use Fake GPS Free"></a>3.3 Use Fake GPS Free</h3><p>This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won’t access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Firstly, go to your device’s settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Once the app is installed, go to Settings &gt; Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg"                      alt="grant Fake GPS access"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location. You can also manually zoom in or out the map to mark your new location.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-8.jpg"                      alt="Close the GPS app"                ></p><h3 id="The-final-words"><a href="#The-final-words" class="headerlink" title="The final words"></a>The final words</h3><p>There you go!

After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.</p><p>The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.</p><p>Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.</p><p>Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087234/19272" target="_top" id="2087234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087234/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.</p><p>Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;</p><ul><li><strong>Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –</strong> Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.</li><li><strong>Fast Attacks are slower on Android –</strong> Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users.

Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.</p><p>Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.</p><p>The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.</p><p>After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.</p><p>Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg"                      alt="pokemon 2"                ></p><p>After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.</p><p>Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.</p><p>Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to.

The three leagues are commonly called the Great League, Ultra League, and Master League. During leagues, there is a certain limit of using the combat power (CP) of Pokémon. Each league requires Pokémon with different CP restrictions and strategies compared with others.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>Pokémon GO PvP</strong> is designed to use an array of Pokémon in a particular league. Notably, you can use only three Pokémon while fighting in a league. Read this article to stay updated about the leagues and achieve the maximum rewards and ranking. By the end, you will also get familiar with the 15 strongest <strong>Pokémon GO PvP</strong> and a robust location spoofer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-strongest-pokemon-in-go-pvp-leagues-1.jpg"                      alt="finding strongest pokemon for pvp league"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-the-Limitations-of-CP-for-Every-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-the-Limitations-of-CP-for-Every-Pokemon-GO-PvP-League" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What Are the Limitations of CP for Every Pokémon GO PvP League</h2><p>For a diverse and challenging gaming experience, <strong>Pokémon GO PvP</strong> comes up with CP limitations. So far, the Great League is easier to start because players with a limit of 1500 CP Pokémon can participate. Then comes the Ultra League, where you’ll find more legendary Pokémon due to its 2500 CP limitation. Unlike other leagues, there is no Pokémon CP limitation in the Master League.</p><p>In addition, these three Pokémon GO leagues often feature themed cups. For instance, Master League Classic is more likely to feature Pokémon with no CP limit but excludes Pokémon powered up with Candy XL and Legendary Pokémon. Anyhow, you can go through the table given below to memorize the CP limit for PvP leagues instantly:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Battle Leagues</strong></th><th><strong>CP Limit</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pokémon GO Great League</strong></td><td>1500 CP Limit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon GO Ultra League</strong></td><td>2500 CP Limit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon GO Master League</strong></td><td>No CP limit</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-2-5-Strongest-Pokemon-for-Pokemon-GO-Great-League"><a href="#Part-2-5-Strongest-Pokemon-for-Pokemon-GO-Great-League" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Strongest Pokémon for Pokémon GO Great League"></a>Part 2. 5 Strongest Pokémon for Pokémon GO Great League</h2><p>Start your Pokémon Go Battle by tapping the Poke Ball and Battle option.

Players get to be a part of the various regions of the Pokemon has now become one with our world. The game requires you to travel to different locations to complete researches, catch Pokemon, defend gyms, and most importantly, complete the Pokedex given by Professor Willow. Niantic’s games are designed to be played with others outdoors. This feature ends up giving players in some parts of the world advantage over others. This is specially to catch regional Pokemon and during ticketed events and sponsored events. Spoofers can avoid the barriers of distance and play anywhere in the world by iSpoofer for pogo installation and other such apps. Niantic, however, does not allow this and considers it the same as hacking. Players who were looking to play and access all the features of the game available all across the world.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-the-iSpoofer-back-on-2020"><a href="#Part-1-Will-the-iSpoofer-back-on-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?"></a>Part 1: Will the iSpoofer back on 2020?</h2><p>iSpoofer has been shut down. All its applications, websites, and other related services have been terminated. iSpoofer for pogo installation does not exist. If any website claims to give access to the application or iSpoofer direct download, it is fake. Also, the new Pokemon Go application version which is 0.195.0 has been updated to detect applications like iSpoofer, so on being detected, it may lead to a warning, or a permanent ban as well. And we don’t see the certainty to get it back soon.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Detailed-guide-of-iSpoofer-for-pogo-installation"><a href="#Part-2-Detailed-guide-of-iSpoofer-for-pogo-installation" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation"></a>Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation</h2><p>This detailed guide for iSpoofer installation is for those who still possess the older version of the app that works in an older iOS version.</p><p><strong>Step 1 –</strong> Install the setup for iSpoofer on your computer if you had got it using. This requires the latest version of iTunes, so make sure that you have it installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/install-ispoofer-setup.jpg"                      alt="install ispoofer setup"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2 –</strong> Once the setup is done, connect your phone to the computer and unlock it. You will have to select the “TRUST” option for the software to do its work. On selecting this option, iSpoofer will download a developer file that will spoof the location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/unlock-and-trust-software.jpg"                      alt="unlock and trust software"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3 –</strong> A map will load on your computer screen, which allows you to enter or point the location. Enter the location of your choice and click on “MOVE”. And that is it! Three simple steps and you have spoofed!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/change-your-phone-location.jpg"                      alt="change your phone location"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-the-iSpoofer-when-you-play-pokemon"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-the-iSpoofer-when-you-play-pokemon" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to use the iSpoofer when you play pokemon"></a>Part 3: How to use the iSpoofer when you play pokemon</h2><p>Follow the tutorial above for ispoofer for pogo installation.

From here you can either use the joystick to move around or use a “.gpx” file to add a preset route for you to move around. That would look like this -</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/gpx-file-for-preset-route.jpg"                      alt="gpx file for preset route"                ></p><p>iSpoofer for pogo installation has the following disadvantages -</p><ul><li>The application cannot work without iTunes and is very dependent on it.</li><li>Niantic can easily detect spoofing through this app and may lead to a ban.</li><li>Movement simulations are hard and unnatural, making it more susceptible to a ban.</li><li>Configurations and settings require some technical knowledge in to troubleshoot any errors.</li><li>The app is prone to crashing a lot.

Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”</strong></em></p><p>If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu"><a href="#Part-1-Things-You-Should-Know-About-Pachirisu" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu"></a>Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu</h2><h3 id="What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features"><a href="#What-are-Pokemon-GO-Pachirisu-Features" class="headerlink" title="What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?"></a>What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?</h3><p>Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.</p><p>It’s an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.</p><p>You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible. Now, let’s look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="Where-to-catch-Pachirisu"><a href="#Where-to-catch-Pachirisu" class="headerlink" title="Where to catch Pachirisu?"></a>Where to catch Pachirisu?</h3><p>As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.</p><h3 id="Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates"><a href="#Are-there-Pachirisu-locations-with-coordinates" class="headerlink" title="Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?"></a>Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?</h3><p>As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.</p><p>As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.</p><p>To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You"><a href="#Part-2-Pachirisu-Pokemon-Go-Regional-Maps-to-Help-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You"></a>Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You</h2><p>Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it.

To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/" >Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.</p><p>With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool</strong></p><p>To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your iPhone to it. Grant the application the needed permissions, agree to the terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 01"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148645/16836" target="_top" id="2148645">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148645" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148645/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2: Teleport to any other location</strong></p><p>After when your device is detected, Dr.Fone will automatically display its exact location on the screen. You can now go to the Teleport Mode from the top-right to spoof your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png"                      alt="virtual location 03"                ></p><p>Now, go to the search bar and just enter the address of the target location or its coordinates that you can get from a Pachirisu Pokemon Go map.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png"                      alt="virtual location 04"                ></p><p>Simply adjust the pin on the map so that you can drop it to the desired spot. Click on the “Move Here” button in the end to spoof your iPhone location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png"                      alt="virtual location 05"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Simulate your movement</strong></p><p>Furthermore, you can even simulate your device movement to ensure that you visit the correct Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn map location. You can go to the one-stop or multi-stop mode on the screen and drop the pins on the map. This will form a route on which you can simulate your movement at the speed of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="virtual location 12"                ></p><p>If you want to move naturally, then you can use the GPS joystick that would be enabled at the bottom of the screen. You can use your keyboard shortcuts or the mouse pointer to move in any route realistically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-15.png"                      alt="virtual location 15"                ></p><h2 id="FAQs-about-Pachirisu-Pokemon-GO-Maps-and-Locations"><a href="#FAQs-about-Pachirisu-Pokemon-GO-Maps-and-Locations" class="headerlink" title="FAQs about Pachirisu Pokémon GO Maps and Locations"></a>FAQs about Pachirisu Pokémon GO Maps and Locations</h2><p><strong>1.

This event is restricted to a few days and limited hours, and you also need tickets to participate.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>There you go! After getting to know about these Pokemon Go regional maps for Pachirisu, you can easily catch this electric-type Pokemon.

In this article, we will discuss what causes the “Failed to detect location (12)” error in Pokemon Go and how you can fix it on your Realme 12 5G.</p><p>Pokémon Go has been on the nerves of its players and this is all because of the AR notion that it presents.

The android and the iOS location services are continuously used by the game to provide the pinpoint locations as well as the game features that are not found in other applications. The use of location through GPS satellites even becomes more important for such gestures. Especially when the player is outdoors it becomes too important to deal with using GPS location.</p><h3 id="iii-Place-Attribution"><a href="#iii-Place-Attribution" class="headerlink" title="iii.

Players can obtain up to 10 Sinnoh Stones during the February Community Day and when the month is Pokemon Go Community Day. 5 Sinnoh Stones can be obtained by beating the three leaders in the battles and another 5 from winning PVP battles against friends.

Dr.Fone’s virtual location allows you to mock your location and lets the application on your phone think that you’re at a place selected in Dr.Fone’s application interface without resulting in any ban or detection from Pokemon Go developers. You can follow the steps listed below in order to catch Pokemon by one click to go anywhere without moving.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Mocking Location Quirk:</strong></p><p>Pokemon Go can be played by using the toolkit of Dr. Fone without shifting. Open the Virtual Location feature using a functioning lightning cable to mock the location and ensure that the iOS device is linked to the application.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png"                      alt="drfone home"                ></p><p>You can press the Get Started” button to start the process upon phone detection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png"                      alt="virtual location 1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Imitating Movement between steps:</strong></p><p>Open the first choice located in the top-right corner until you enter Dr.Fone’s GUI, which helps you to fake movement between the two locations. Select the location pin found in the search bar and press the “Move Here” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png"                      alt="virtual location 8"                ></p><p>You want to make a motion, and navigate to the “March” button to start the simulation, enter the magnitude of times. By default, the movement is set to one, but the user can override it, and the application will move accordingly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png"                      alt="virtual location 9"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002019/7443" target="_top" id="2002019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002019/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>For the Pokemon Go application, the new position will appear as real and will presume that you are walking between the two selected locations you have selected on the Dr. Fone screen. The walking pace can also be changed at the bottom of the screen using the sliding menu. This way, without knowing it, you can use the fake movement of the desired position, and your application will not be prohibited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png"                      alt="virtual location 10"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png"                      alt="virtual location 11"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:</strong></p><p>The application by Dr.Fone also helps you to mock movement between more than two spots. The function is named after the multi-stop route that can be selected from the toolbox category gui found at the top-right corner, which lets you drop different unique stops located on the map, and your location will behave accordingly as handled by Dr.Fone’s virtual location application.</p><p>Click the ‘March’ button to allow the system to simulate motion by selecting the correct options. You’ll have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. The virtual motion simulation software for Dr. Fone makes your life easier and helps you to do the job without thinking about travel costs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png"                      alt="virtual location 12"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Requirement-and-Evolving-Pokemon’s-Using-Sinnoh-Stone"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Requirement-and-Evolving-Pokemon’s-Using-Sinnoh-Stone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Essential Requirement and Evolving Pokémon’s Using Sinnoh Stone"></a>Part 3: Essential Requirement and Evolving Pokémon’s Using Sinnoh Stone</h2><p>Only the trainers above the 10th Level have access to acquire Sinnoh Stone. The Sinnoh Stone can be obtained from Training Battles and Training with Team Leaders. You also need 100 candies for each of the Pokemon. Once you have got your hands on Sinnoh Stones and now you want to know where they should be used, there’s numerous 4th generation Pokémon who require Sinnoh Stone for their upgrade. Mamoswine is one of the best if you’re prioritizing attackers for a raid because it has a mix of extremely high CP with the strong ground and ice-type moves.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Sinnoh Stone, a rare evolution item, is one of the Perks of Pokemon Go letting you evolve your favorite Pokemon and keep them throughout your journey in the game.

If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.</p><p>While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s <strong>how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking</strong> by using a GPS spoofer.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, unlock your Realme 12 5G and go to its Settings &gt; About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg"                      alt="unlock the Developer Options settings"                ></p></li><li><p>Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings &gt; Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg"                      alt="location spoofing app"                ></p></li><li><p>That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go. Do the same a few times to cover a prominent distance.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-4.jpg"                      alt="change your location to a few meters away"                ></p></li></ol><p>Just be sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect that you are using a GPS spoofer to hatch eggs.

Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg"                      alt="Play Pokemon Go with a drone"                ></p><p><strong>Things to Remember</strong></p><ul><li>While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.</li><li>Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.</li><li>Enable the Find My Realme 12 5G service on your Realme 12 5G or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.</li><li>Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.</li></ul><h2 id="Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users"><a href="#Way-4-Exchange-the-Friend-Code-of-Other-Pokemon-Go-Users" class="headerlink" title="Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users"></a>Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users</h2><p>A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile. Adjacent to the “Me” section, tap on the “Friends” section instead.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-6.jpg"                      alt="go to your profile"                ></p></li><li><p>Here, you can see a list of your friends and an option to add more friends on Pokemon Go. To add a friend, you need to enter their code which can be obtained from any dedicated forum or even Reddit.</p></li><li><p>That’s it! Once you have added a friend, go to their profile, and choose to trade or send them a gift. For instance, you can send them an exclusive egg and help them hack eggs without walking.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-7.jpg"                      alt="help friends hack eggs"                ></p></li></ol><p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong></p><p>If you have a friend who goes for a jog or walks a lot, then you can just open Pokemon Go on their phone and let them cover the distance for you as well!</p><h2 id="Way-5-Use-Your-Pokecoins-to-Purchase-More-Incubators"><a href="#Way-5-Use-Your-Pokecoins-to-Purchase-More-Incubators" class="headerlink" title="Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators"></a>Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators</h2><p>You might already know that Pokecoins is the official currency of Pokemon Go. Using it, you can buy all kinds of tools, incense, eggs, incubators, and even Pokemons. Though, if you wish to learn how to hack eggs in Pokemon Go without moving, then consider getting some incubators. There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.</p><ol><li><p>Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.</p></li><li><p>From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want. For instance, $0.99 would let you purchase 100 Pokecoins.</p><p> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-8.jpeg"                      alt="get Pokecoins"                ></p></li><li><p>Great!

You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.</p><p>Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard"                ></p><h2 id="Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-7-Use-a-Roomba-while-Playing-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go"></a>Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg"                      alt="play Pokemon Go with Roomba"                ></p><h2 id="Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-8-Create-a-Model-Railroad-to-Play-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go"></a>Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go</h2><p>If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg"                      alt="Model Railroad"                ></p><h2 id="Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Way-9-Use-A-Turntable-to-Hatch-Eggs-without-Walking-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go"></a>Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go</h2><p>Do you have a turntable? If yes, you are lucky! You can use it that you used to listen to music to trick Pokemon Go that you’re walking and hatch the eggs.

This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:</p><p>Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable &gt; Turn on the turntable &gt; Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch.

Developed by Niantic for iOS and Android, this single console game lets us catch all sorts of Pokemons in different areas. Though, to catch Pokemons, users are expected to visit different places and step out. Needless to say, it restricts the scope to <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/pokemon-go/best-pokemon-type.html" >catch Pokemons <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and users often look for Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android. This would let you change your location and <a class="link"   href="https://www.virtuallocation.com/android-location/" >spoof Pokemon Go on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> pretty easily.</p><p>In this guide, I will teach you how to use reliable Android Pokemon Go spoof apps and the risks related to them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-1.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-so-many-people-seek-Pokemon-Go-spoofing-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Why-so-many-people-seek-Pokemon-Go-spoofing-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?"></a>Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?</h2><p>Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.</p><p>If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020"><a href="#Part-2-Must-know-Risks-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020"></a>Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020</h2><p>A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android’s features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.</p><ul><li>If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won’t sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.</li><li>The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.</li><li>The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Go spoofing risks"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing"><a href="#Part-3-3-Best-Methods-for-Android-Pokemon-Go-Spoofing" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing"></a>Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing</h2><p>As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let’s explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.</p><h3 id="3-1-Use-a-VPN"><a href="#3-1-Use-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="3.1 Use a VPN"></a>3.1 Use a VPN</h3><p>A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.</p><p>Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here’s how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install Pokemon Go on your Realme 12 5G and create your account if you haven’t already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can’t detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme 12 5G device again and access the new location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-3.jpg"                      alt="vpn for android"                ></p><h3 id="3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go"><a href="#3-2-Use-Fake-GPS-Go" class="headerlink" title="3.2 Use Fake GPS Go"></a>3.2 Use Fake GPS Go</h3><p>If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme 12 5G device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme 12 5G and enable the mock location feature from it.

Ideally, you can partake in a Pokemon PvP battle locally or remotely. It is a 3 vs. 3 battle in which you have to select your best Pokemons to fight with other trainers. To help you become a PvP Poke master, I have come up with this detailed guide that will certainly come in handy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-pvp-battle-tips-banner.jpg"                      alt="pokemon pvp battle tips banner"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-1-Pro-Strategies-to-Follow-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 1: Pro Strategies to Follow in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>If you want to be good at the Pokemon Go PvP battles, then you must understand how the game works. Once you are ready, I would recommend some of these Pokemon PvP strategies that are followed by pro players.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues"><a href="#Tip-1-Start-from-the-low-leagues" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Start from the low leagues"></a>Tip 1: Start from the low leagues</h3><p>As you know, there are three different leagues to participate in Pokemon Go PvP battles. If you are a beginner or don’t have too many Pokemons, then you should start from the lower categories and gradually climb your way up. You can find these three categories in the PoGo PVP mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Great League:</strong> Max 1500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Ultra League:</strong> Max 2500 CP (per Pokemon)</li><li><strong>Master League:</strong> No CP limit</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/leagues-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="leagues in pokemon pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135315/14409" target="_top" id="2135315">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135315" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135315/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The Master Leagues is mostly reserved for pro players since there is no CP limit for Pokemons. The Great League is the best category to learn and try different Pokemon combinations.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves"><a href="#Tip-2-Master-all-the-Battle-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves"></a>Tip 2: Master all the Battle Moves</h3><p>Ideally, there are four different moves in any PvP Poke battle that you must master. The more battles you partake in, the better you would become.</p><ul><li><strong>Fast attacks:</strong> These are the basic attacks that are done more frequently than others.</li><li><strong>Charge attack:</strong> Once your Pokemon has enough energy, you can do a charge attack that would do more damage.</li><li><strong>Shield:</strong> This would shield your Pokemon from the enemy attacks. In the starting, you would only get 2 shields per battle.</li><li><strong>Swapping:</strong> Since you get 3 Pokemons, don’t forget to swap them during the battle. You can only swap Pokemons once in every 60 seconds.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135411/19272" target="_top" id="2135411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons"><a href="#Tip-3-Check-your-Opponent’s-Pokemons" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons"></a>Tip 3: Check your Opponent’s Pokemons</h3><p>This has to be the most important thing that you should check before you start any Pokemon Go PvP battle. Right before starting the battle, you can check a list of the prospective opponents in your league. You can have a glimpse of their main Pokemons and pick your Pokemons accordingly so that you can counter their picks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/opponent-screen-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="opponent screen pokemon pvp"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139118/17108" target="_top" id="2139118">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139118" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139118/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta"><a href="#Tip-4-Know-the-current-Meta" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Know the current Meta"></a>Tip 4: Know the current Meta</h3><p>In nutshell, Meta Pokemons are the ones that are considered superior to other picks since they are more powerful. You might already know that some Pokemons are just stronger than others. Since Nintendo keeps balancing Pokemons with constant nerfs and buffs, you should do some research in advance.</p><p>There are several sources like the Silph Arena, PvPoke, and Pokebattler that you can check to know the current meta Pokemons.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy"><a href="#Tip-5-Shield-Baiting-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy"></a>Tip 5: Shield Baiting Strategy</h3><p>This is one of the most effective Pokemon Go PvP strategies that you must try. You might already know that there are two kinds of charged attacks a Pokemon can do (mild and strong). During the battle, you need to first poke your enemy and have enough energy for both moves.</p><p>Now, instead of going with your ultimate attack, only perform the mild one. Your opponent might assume that you are going for an ultimate and would use their shield instead. Once their shield is used, you can go for a stronger attack to win.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/shield-baiting-strategy-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="shield baiting strategy pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves"><a href="#Tip-6-Learn-to-Counter-Fast-Moves" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves"></a>Tip 6: Learn to Counter Fast Moves</h3><p>To make the most of your shield and energy levels, you should learn how to counter moves. The first way to do this is by picking your Pokemons wisely. Your Pokemon would automatically get less damage if it can counter your opponent’s Pokemon.</p><p>During any PvP Poke battle, keep a count of your opponent’s moves to calculate when they would do a charged attack. Since you would only get 2 shields at the starting of the battle, make sure that you only use them at the time of need.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/fast-moves-in-pokemon-pvp.jpg"                      alt="fast moves in pokemon pvp"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap"><a href="#Tip-7-Sacrifice-Swap" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap"></a>Tip 7: Sacrifice Swap</h3><p>This might sound surprising, but sometimes we have to sacrifice a Pokemon in a fight to win the battle. For instance, you can consider sacrificing a Pokemon that is at low energy and won’t be of much help later.</p><p>In this way, you can swap it in the battle and let it take all the charge attack of your opponent. Once the Pokemon is sacrificed and has drained the opponent’s Pokemon, you can place another Pokemon to claim the victory.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP"><a href="#Part-2-What-Changes-should-be-implemented-in-Pokemon-Go-PvP" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?"></a>Part 2: What Changes should be implemented in Pokemon Go PvP?</h2><p>Even after the much-anticipated release of PoGo PvP, a lot of players are not satisfied with it. If Nintendo wants to improve Pokemon PvP and make their players happy, then the following changes should be made.</p><ul><li>The PvP Poke battles are based on the CP level of Pokemons instead of their IV levels, which is something most of the players dislike.</li><li>Nintendo should focus on making the battles smoother as a lot of players encounter unwanted bugs and glitches.</li><li>Apart from that, players also complain about unfair matchmaking in which pro players are often matched against beginners.</li><li>The overall pool of Pokemons is not balanced – if a player has meta Pokemons then they can easily win the game.</li><li>The PoGo PvP battles are more centric on the picks and less on the actual battle. Players would like more strategic moves and in-battle options to help them fight.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/cp-iv-level-trick-pokemon.jpg"                      alt="cp iv level trick pokemon"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Select-the-Best-Pokemons-for-PvP-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?"></a>Part 3: How to Select the Best Pokemons for PvP Battles?</h2><p>During any Pokemon PvP battle, the type of Pokemons you pick can either make or break the results. Firstly, consider the following things in mind before you start any PvP Poke battle.</p><ul><li><strong>Team composition</strong></li></ul><p>Try to come up with a balanced team that would have both defensive and attacking Pokemons. Also, you should include Pokemons of different types in your team.</p><ul><li><strong>Focus on attacks</strong></li></ul><p>Presently, some attacks like thunderbolt are considered extremely strong in PoGo PvP battles. You should get to know about all the major attacks of your Pokemons to pick the best ones.</p><ul><li><strong>Consider Pokemon Stats</strong></li></ul><p>Most importantly, you should be aware of the defense, attack, IV, CP, and all the vital stats of your Pokemons to pick the best ones in the league of your choice.

You can consider getting Altaria, Deoxys, or Mantine as they are the strongest attackers.</p><ul><li><strong>Attacker</strong></li></ul><p>If you want to fight more aggressively in the Pokemon PvP battle, then consider getting some attackers like Bastiodon, Medicham, and Whiscash.</p><ul><li><strong>Defender</strong></li></ul><p>While making your Pokemon PvP team, make sure that you have at least one strong defender like Froslass, Zweilous, or Swampert.</p><ul><li><strong>Closer</strong></li></ul><p>In the end, make sure that you have a perfect Pokemon that can end the battle and secure a win. Pokemons like Azymarill, Umbreon, and Skarmory are some of the best closers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/skarmory-in-pokemon-go.jpg"                      alt="skarmory in pokemon go"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles"><a href="#Part-4-Secrets-about-the-new-Mechanics-in-PvP-Pokemon-Go-Battles" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles"></a>Part 4: Secrets about the new Mechanics in PvP Pokemon Go Battles</h2><p>Lastly, if you want to level up in PvP Poke battles, then you should get to know about these three important mechanisms.</p><ul><li><strong>Turns</strong></li></ul><p>Make sure that you keep an eye on the DTP and EPT values as they would indicate how much damage and energy is left. In the new mechanism, everything is about taking turns in 0.5 seconds. This will help you not only counter but also implement your moves before your opponent.</p><ul><li><strong>Energy</strong></li></ul><p>You might already know that every Pokemon starts with 100-value energy. While switching Pokemons, make sure that you remember their energy value as that would be retained later on. The energy value of every Pokemon will also help you make a charged move in time.</p><ul><li><strong>Switching</strong></li></ul><p>Switching is another strategic account in the new mechanism of Pokemon PvP battles in which we enter new Pokemons to the battle. Please note that the switching action has a 60-second cooldown window and you would only get 12 seconds to choose your next Pokemon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/mechanism-in-pokemon-pvp-battle.jpg"                      alt="mechanism in pokemon pvp battle"                ></p><p>There you go!

If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.</p><p>There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay.

This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Rare-Candy-Cheat-Fire-Red-2.jpg"                      alt="Pokemon Rare Candy Trainer Card"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-get-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-get-rare-candy-in-Pokemon-Go-Fire-Red" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to get rare candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red?"></a>Part 2: How to get rare candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red?</h2><p>There are three main ways in which you can get Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red.

The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader.

It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go"><a href="#Part-2-What-can-you-get-from-trainer-battles-Pokemon-go" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?"></a>Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?</h2><p>This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight.

The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Pokemon-Go-Cooldown-Chart-On-Realme-12-5G"><a href="#Pokemon-Go-Cooldown-Chart-On-Realme-12-5G" class="headerlink" title="Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Realme 12 5G"></a>Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Realme 12 5G</h2><p>Pokémon Go is a viral game; hence many people try to cheat to achieve high scores and invade others’ privacy. The good news is that the Pokémon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pokémon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.</p><p>What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-does-Soft-Banned-Cooldown-Mean"><a href="#Part-1-What-does-Soft-Banned-Cooldown-Mean" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What does Soft Banned &amp; Cooldown Mean?"></a>Part 1: What does Soft Banned &amp; Cooldown Mean?</h2><p>A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pokémon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you’re soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.</p><p>What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban"><a href="#Part-2-What-Happens-When-You-Get-a-Soft-Ban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?"></a>Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?</h2><p>When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go"><a href="#Part-3-Cooldown-Rules-and-How-to-Avoid-Soft-Ban-in-Pokemon-Go" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?"></a>Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?</h2><h3 id="1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down"><a href="#1-How-long-does-it-take-for-a-Pokemon-to-Cool-Down" class="headerlink" title="1. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?"></a>1. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?</h3><p>The cooldown time is proportional to the distance covered by the player. So, when you perform an action marking our location, the cooldown time starts, and you must wait until the cooldown time is over. Here is a quick review of how long the cooldown you can expect.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Total Distance Covered</strong></th><th><strong>Cooldown Period</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1 km</td><td>30 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>5 km</td><td>2 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>10 km</td><td>6 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>25 km</td><td>11 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>30 km</td><td>14 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>65 km</td><td>22 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>81 km</td><td>25 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>100 km</td><td>35 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>250 km</td><td>45 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>500 km</td><td>1 hour</td></tr><tr><td>750 km</td><td>1 hour 20 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>1000 km</td><td>1 hour 30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>&gt;1500 km</td><td>2 hour</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="2-How-long-must-I-wait-to-avoid-a-softban"><a href="#2-How-long-must-I-wait-to-avoid-a-softban" class="headerlink" title="2. How long must I wait to avoid a softban?"></a>2. How long must I wait to avoid a softban?</h3><p>The waiting period for a soft ban is around 12 hours. After this time, if you can try and catch a Pokémon, it means the soft ban is over.</p><h3 id="3-Actions-that-Do-trigger-cooldown"><a href="#3-Actions-that-Do-trigger-cooldown" class="headerlink" title="3. Actions that Do trigger cooldown?"></a>3. Actions that Do trigger cooldown?</h3><p>The main reasons for a soft ban are GPS spoofing, changing your location to a distant place in a short time, and traveling too fast to combat playing while driving. Sharing accounts is another reason.</p><p>So, what action of a player can trigger a cooldown? Let us list them here for quick reference.</p><ul><li>If you catch a wild Pokémon, like the ones coming from Incense, Meltan’s Mystery Box،, Lure Modules, and Special Lures.</li><li>Another trigger of the cooldown is dropping the ball on the encounter screen.</li><li>When you feed a wild Pokémon a berry.</li><li>When you feed a gym defender on a screen radar.</li><li>Gym battles.</li><li>When a Pokémon flees, if you try to catch it.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Actions-that-DO-NOT-trigger-cooldown"><a href="#4-Actions-that-DO-NOT-trigger-cooldown" class="headerlink" title="4.

We have discussed the optimal cooldown time in the above section.</li><li>Always log off from Pokémon before teleporting so the game does not detect your actions. For logging out, go to settings in your game by clicking the Pokeball in the center of the screen.

If you’re one of them, this guide will help. In today’s article, we are going to discuss if you can download <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong> or not and what are some of the best solutions to fake GPS location on an Android device.</p><p>So, without any further ado, let’s get started.</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part1" >Part 1: Can I download the iSpoofer on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part2" >Part 2: Common ways to spoof on Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-download-the-iSpoofer-on-Android"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-download-the-iSpoofer-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 1:  Can I download the iSpoofer on Android"></a><strong><strong>Part 1:  Can I download the iSpoofer on Android</strong></strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, iSpoofer isn’t available for Android. It’s an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won’t be able to download <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong> at all.</p><p>However, the good news is that you don’t need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that’ll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you’ll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Common-ways-to-spoof-on-Android"><a href="#Part-2-Common-ways-to-spoof-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android"></a><strong><strong>Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android</strong></strong></h2><p>When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you’ll have to be extra cautious. <em>Why?</em> Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren’t reliable and may damage your smartphone’s overall functionality as well.</p><p>Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.</p><ol><li><strong>Use VMOS</strong></li></ol><p>VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you’ll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you’ll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg"                      alt="vmos"                ></p><p>The only downside of using VMOS is that it’s extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you’ll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn’t have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Root Your Device</strong></li></ol><p>Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you’ll root your device, you won’t be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don’t want to void your smartphone’s warranty, ‘rooting’ may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Use PGSharp</strong></li></ol><p>PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to <strong>iSpoofer for Android</strong>. It’s a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick. The best part about using PGSharp is that it’s compatible with all Android devices. You won’t have to root your device to install and run PGSharp.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg"                      alt="pgsharp"                ></p><p>You can either choose the free or the paid version of the app. Of course, the latter comes with a few additional features, but if you only want to fake location in Pokemon Go, the free version of PGSharp will get the job done as well.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that PGSharp isn’t available on Google Play Store and you’ll have to download it from the official <a href="https://www.pgsharp.com/"><u>PGSharp website</u></a>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959759/19272" target="_top" id="1959759">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959759" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959759/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Extension-safest-way-to-spoof-on-iOS-Dr-Fone-virtual-location"><a href="#Extension-safest-way-to-spoof-on-iOS-Dr-Fone-virtual-location" class="headerlink" title="Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location"></a><strong>Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location</strong></h2><p>So, that’s how you can fake GPS location on an Android device and collect different types of Pokemon in Pokemon Go. Even though iSPoofer isn’t available for Android, you can still use the above three methods to mock location without any effort.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that iSpoofer is permanently shut down and you can no longer install it on iOS devices as well. Even the iSpoofer website is down and if you want to fake location on your iPhone&#x2F;iPad, you’ll have to look for other options.
