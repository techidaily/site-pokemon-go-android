## 15 Best Strongest Pokémon To Use in Pokémon GO PvP Leagues For Honor Magic 6 Lite

“Player vs Player” or “PvP” leagues introduced three battle leagues with Pokémon GO trainers. The three leagues are commonly called the Great League, Ultra League, and Master League. During leagues, there is a certain limit of using the combat power (CP) of Pokémon. Each league requires Pokémon with different CP restrictions and strategies compared with others.

Moreover, **Pokémon GO PvP** is designed to use an array of Pokémon in a particular league. Notably, you can use only three Pokémon while fighting in a league. Read this article to stay updated about the leagues and achieve the maximum rewards and ranking. By the end, you will also get familiar with the 15 strongest **Pokémon GO PvP** and a robust location spoofer.

## Part 1. What Are the Limitations of CP for Every Pokémon GO PvP League

For a diverse and challenging gaming experience, **Pokémon GO PvP** comes up with CP limitations. So far, the Great League is easier to start because players with a limit of 1500 CP Pokémon can participate. Then comes the Ultra League, where you'll find more legendary Pokémon due to its 2500 CP limitation. Unlike other leagues, there is no Pokémon CP limitation in the Master League.

In addition, these three Pokémon GO leagues often feature themed cups. For instance, Master League Classic is more likely to feature Pokémon with no CP limit but excludes Pokémon powered up with Candy XL and Legendary Pokémon. Anyhow, you can go through the table given below to memorize the CP limit for PvP leagues instantly:

| **Battle Leagues** | **CP Limit** |
| --- | --- |
| **Pokémon GO Great League** | 1500 CP Limit |
| **Pokémon GO Ultra League** | 2500 CP Limit |
| **Pokémon GO Master League** | No CP limit |

## How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Honor Magic 6 Lite?

If you have been playing Pokemon games (like Sun/Moon or Sword/Shield), then you must be familiar with their team building. To succeed, players are encouraged to create teams of their Pokemons that they have to use to complete missions. Though, it might take a while to master how you create a winning team. To help you, I have come up with some smart tips that would let you come up with some amazing Pokemon teams.

![Pokemon Team Building Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What are Some Good Pokemon Team Examples?

To understand the dynamics of team composition, you should know that there are ideally different kinds of Pokemons:

- Sweeper: These Pokemons are mostly used to attack as they can do a lot of damage and even move swiftly. Though, they have low defense stats and can be of a physical or special type.
- Tanker: These Pokemons have high defense stats and can take a lot of damage. Though, they have slow movement and low attacking stats.
- Annoyer: They are known for their fast movement and while their damage might not be so high, they can annoy your opponents.
- Cleric: These are supportive Pokemons that are mostly used to heal or boost the stats of other Pokemons.
- Drainer: These are also supportive Pokemons, but they can drain the stats of your opponents while healing your team.
- Wall: These are tougher than tank Pokemons and can take a substantial amount of damage from sweepers.

![hola free vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-4.jpg)

Based on these different types of Pokemons, you can come up with the following teams to win your next battle:

### 1\. 2x Physical Sweeper, 2x Special Sweeper, Tanker, and Annoyer

If you want to have an attacking team, then this would be the perfect combination. While the annoyer and tanker would drain the HP of the opponents, your sweeper Pokemons can finish them with their high attacking stats.

### 2\. 3x Sweepers (Physical/Special/Mixed), Tanker, Wall, and Annoyer

This is one of the most balanced Pokemon teams that would work in almost every situation. In this, we have a tanker and a wall to take damage from the opponent’s Pokemon. Also, we have three different types of sweepers to do maximum damage.

![Balanced Pokemon Teams](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-3.jpg)

### 3\. Drainer, Tanker, Cleric, and 3 Sweepers (Physical/Special/Mixed)

In some situations (when there are lots of sweepers in the opponent’s team), this team would excel. Your support Pokemons (drainers and clerics) would boost the HP of sweepers while the tanker would take the damage.

### 4\. Rayquaza, Arceus, Dialga, Kyogre, Palkia, and Groudon

This is one of the most legendary teams in Pokemon that any player can have. The only issue is catching these legendary Pokemons can take a lot of time and effort, but it would certainly be worth it.

### 5\. Garchomp, Decidueye, Salazzle, Araquanid, Metagross, and Weavile

Even if you don’t have a lot of experience in the game, you can try this power-packed team in Pokemon games like Sun and Moon. It has the perfect balance of attacking and defensive Pokemons that would excel in every situation.

![Attacking Pokemon Teams](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-4.jpg)

## Part 2: Things to Consider while Creating your Pokemon Team

Since there could be so many ways for coming up with a Pokemon team, I would recommend following these suggestions:

### Tip 1: Consider your strategy

The most important thing that you need to know is the overall strategy that you have to focus on game. For instance, at times, players would like to play defensively while others want to focus on attacking. Therefore, you can come up with a team composition according to your needs.

### Tip 2: Try to attain a balanced team

Needless to say, if you have all attacking or all defensive Pokemons in your team, then you might not get the desired results. That’s why it is recommended to have a mixed bag of sweepers, healers, tankers, annoyers, etc. in your team.

### Tip 3: Don’t pick Pokemons with common weaknesses
