## A Working Guide For Pachirisu Pokemon Go Map On Nubia Z50S Pro

_**“I have been trying to catch Pachirisu for a while now, but I can’t seem to locate it anywhere. Can someone tell me about a working Pachirisu Pokemon Go map?”**_

If you are also planning to catch this electric-type Pokemon, then you can have a similar query as well. Since Pachirisu is a region-specific Pokemon, chances are that you might not see it spawning everywhere. Though, if you use the right Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, then you can easily locate it. In this post, I’m going to suggest some working Pachirisu regional maps so that you can catch this Pokemon like a pro.


## Part 1: Things You Should Know About Pachirisu

### What are Pokemon GO Pachirisu Features?

Due to the many tinkles around Pachirisu, this part will delve into every detail of this Pokemon. It’s a squirrel-like creature that can glide after spreading its arms. This electric-type Pokemon is region-exclusive and only available in the Sinnoh region. The best moves of Pachirisu are Thunderbolt and Volt Switch, which are perfect for defense and offense.

It's an EleSquirrel Pokemon that can win battles in rainy weather. Pachirisu is good against flying, steel, and electric-type Pokemon GO moves, whereas it is vulnerable to ground-type moves. This cute little guy would be an excellent pick in battles that can attack with fur balls.

You can evolve it into Mega Pachirisu with mega gems, but more evolution isn’t possible. Now, let's look at some stats in the table below to understand it better:

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Pokemon No</b></td><td>417</td></tr><tr><td><b>Maximum CP</b></td><td>1372</td></tr><tr><td><b>Attack</b></td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td><b>Stamin</b>a</td><td>155</td></tr><tr><td><b>Defense</b></td><td>172</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>0.4m</td></tr><tr><td><b>Weight</b></td><td>3.9kg</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Where to catch Pachirisu?

As you know, some Pokemons like Pachirisu can be region-specific. Mostly, it is observed that Pachirisu is spawned in the northern regions of Canada, Alaska, and Russia. You can find it in the wildering, electric hubs, parks, and even some colder regions. Since it can hide pretty well, you would have to keep a keen eye to look for it. A Pokemon Go regional map for Pachirisu can further help you.

### Are there Pachirisu locations with coordinates?

As introduced before, Pachirisu is primarily found in areas of Alaska, Canada, and certain parts of Russia. If you are in one of these regions, you have a chance to encounter and catch Pachirisu in the wild.

As for providing specific coordinates for Pachirisu locations, it is important to note that Pokémon spawns can change frequently and depend on various factors. Therefore, it is not possible to provide fixed coordinates for Pachirisu encounters as they can vary over time.

To increase your chances of finding Pachirisu, it is recommended to visit areas with a higher likelihood of spawning regional exclusives, such as parks, tourist attractions, or areas with a diverse range of Pokémon spawns. Additionally, participating in Pokémon Go events or connecting with local Pokémon Go communities can provide valuable information on Pachirisu sightings in your region.

## Part 2: Pachirisu Pokemon Go Regional Maps to Help You

Since Pachirisu is mostly spawned in Alaska, Canada, and Russia, you might need to take some extra measures to locate it. I would recommend these Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn maps to assist you.

### 1\. The Silph Road

The Silph Road is the biggest crowd-sourced Pokemon Go map that will let you know about the recently spawning of Pachirisu. Since the directory has data about tons of Pokemons, you can go to its filters and select Pachirisu to save time. This will let you know the recent spawning of the Pokemon with its exact coordinates.

**Website:** [https://thesilphroad.com/](https://thesilphroad.com/)

### 2\. Poke Map

If you are looking for an active Pachirisu Pokemon Go map, then you can head to this freely available website. You can know the active regions where the Pokemon has been found recently. Not just that, it will also let you know about other details of the game like raids, Pokestops, gyms, etc.

**Website:** [https://www.pokemap.net/](https://www.pokemap.net/)

### 3\. PoGo Map

Earlier, PoGo Map was available as an app, but now you can only use its website to know the spawning of Pokemons. Since it is a global directory, you can easily use it as a Pachirisu map for Pokemon Go. You can zoom in to know the spawn location of Pachirisu with its coordinates or the exact address. Besides Pachirisu, it can also help you catch several other regional Pokemons as well.

**Website:** [https://www.pogomap.info/location/](https://www.pogomap.info/location/)

### 4\. PokeHunter

PokeHunter is a well-known Pokemon GO tracker that provides exact information on PokeStops and gyms. It will inform you about the Pachirisu, ex-Raid battles, and locations of other Pokémon characters. With real-time tracking, it is accessible to all devices, such as PCs and mobile phones. Besides, this map can show the energy level of Pokemon and let you decide which to catch.

## Part 3: How to Catch Pachirisu on Pokemon Go from Home?

If you don’t live in Canada, Alaska, or Russia, where Pachirisu is naturally spawned, then catching it can be tough. To make things easier, you can just use a location spoofer application. While there are plenty of mock GPS apps for Android devices, iPhone users often find it hard to spoof their device location. Well, in this case, I would suggest [Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) that can spoof your iPhone location without jailbreaking it.

With just a few clicks, you can directly teleport to anywhere in the world by entering the location’s address or its coordinates. Furthermore, you can use the application to simulate your movement and even use its GPS joystick to move smoothly. Once you have noted the coordinates or address from the Pokemon Go Pachirisu map, you can follow these steps:

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the tool**

To start with, just launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) application on your computer and connect your iPhone to it. Grant the application the needed permissions, agree to the terms, and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Teleport to any other location**

After when your device is detected, Dr.Fone will automatically display its exact location on the screen. You can now go to the Teleport Mode from the top-right to spoof your location.

![virtual location 03](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Now, go to the search bar and just enter the address of the target location or its coordinates that you can get from a Pachirisu Pokemon Go map.

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Simply adjust the pin on the map so that you can drop it to the desired spot. Click on the “Move Here” button in the end to spoof your iPhone location.

![virtual location 05](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)

**Step 3: Simulate your movement**

Furthermore, you can even simulate your device movement to ensure that you visit the correct Pachirisu Pokemon Go spawn map location. You can go to the one-stop or multi-stop mode on the screen and drop the pins on the map. This will form a route on which you can simulate your movement at the speed of your choice.

![virtual location 12](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

If you want to move naturally, then you can use the GPS joystick that would be enabled at the bottom of the screen. You can use your keyboard shortcuts or the mouse pointer to move in any route realistically.

## Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Nubia Z50S Pro

According to the original gameplay, you need to be physically present on the battleground to catch the Pokémon. It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.

The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to [spoof Pokémon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html). But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.

There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.

In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.

## Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned

The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.

![pokemon go ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg)

The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:

- Engaging in harassment against any player in the game
- Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go
- Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo
- Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations

If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.

## Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp

Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.

Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.

Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.

![pgsharp plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg)

To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.

But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.

## Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg)

Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.

## 15 Best Strongest Pokémon To Use in Pokémon GO PvP Leagues For Nubia Z50S Pro

“Player vs Player” or “PvP” leagues introduced three battle leagues with Pokémon GO trainers. The three leagues are commonly called the Great League, Ultra League, and Master League. During leagues, there is a certain limit of using the combat power (CP) of Pokémon. Each league requires Pokémon with different CP restrictions and strategies compared with others.

Moreover, **Pokémon GO PvP** is designed to use an array of Pokémon in a particular league. Notably, you can use only three Pokémon while fighting in a league. Read this article to stay updated about the leagues and achieve the maximum rewards and ranking. By the end, you will also get familiar with the 15 strongest **Pokémon GO PvP** and a robust location spoofer.

![finding strongest pokemon for pvp league](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-strongest-pokemon-in-go-pvp-leagues-1.jpg)

## Part 1. What Are the Limitations of CP for Every Pokémon GO PvP League

For a diverse and challenging gaming experience, **Pokémon GO PvP** comes up with CP limitations. So far, the Great League is easier to start because players with a limit of 1500 CP Pokémon can participate. Then comes the Ultra League, where you'll find more legendary Pokémon due to its 2500 CP limitation. Unlike other leagues, there is no Pokémon CP limitation in the Master League.

In addition, these three Pokémon GO leagues often feature themed cups. For instance, Master League Classic is more likely to feature Pokémon with no CP limit but excludes Pokémon powered up with Candy XL and Legendary Pokémon. Anyhow, you can go through the table given below to memorize the CP limit for PvP leagues instantly:

| **Battle Leagues** | **CP Limit** |
| --- | --- |
