## Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Realme GT 5

According to the original gameplay, you need to be physically present on the battleground to catch the Pokémon. It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.

The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to [spoof Pokémon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html).

Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.
