## Part 1. What Are the Possible Leagues in Pokémon GO PvP

There are three core leagues in the trainer battles in Pokémon GO, namely Great, Ultra, and Master. Each of these leagues has its own CP limitation and comes in rotation during each season.

![pokemon pvp battles](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/everything-to-know-about-pvp-2.jpg)

### 1\. Great League

The Great League is the easiest league to jump into for beginners. Here, only Pokémon with 1,500 CP or less can join the battle. This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.

### 2\. Ultra League

The next league that comes is Ultra League, which raises the CP cap to 2,500. Legendary Pokémon start making appearances here, with a focus on defensive power. Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.

In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.

### 3\. Master League

The Master League removes all CP limits, allowing any Pokémon to jump into the action. Here, Trainers tend to lean towards Pokémon with high maximum CP. Pokémon like Groudon and Origin Forme Giratina are notable here, making them fit for any kind of battle.

**Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:**

To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.

![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.

**Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.

To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the 'March' button. You will be required to do the Pokémon Go walking illusion at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual movement imitation application eases your life and lets you do the job without being concerned about travel costs.

## Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pokémon Go?

Meltan is a legendary steel-type Pokémon that was initially launched in Pokémon Go. It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.

The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.

## Conclusion

Pokémon is one of the most enjoyable games, not only because it yields prizes such as the mystery box Pokémon, Meltan Pokémon, shiny Meltan Pokémon go, but it also develops players' interest completely. It manifests a 3D view making it appear as the actual life. Furthermore, with an application like Dr. Fone Virtual Location, you turn out to be an addict as it helps you imitate your GPS position and proceed across the path you set up on the map.
