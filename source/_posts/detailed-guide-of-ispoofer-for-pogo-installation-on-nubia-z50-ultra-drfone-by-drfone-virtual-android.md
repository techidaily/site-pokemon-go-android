iSpoofer has been shut down. All its applications, websites, and other related services have been terminated. iSpoofer for pogo installation does not exist.

Also, the new Pokemon Go application version which is 0.195.0 has been updated to detect applications like iSpoofer, so on being detected, it may lead to a warning, or a permanent ban as well. And we don’t see the certainty to get it back soon.

## Part 2: Detailed guide of iSpoofer for pogo installation

This detailed guide for iSpoofer installation is for those who still possess the older version of the app that works in an older iOS version.
