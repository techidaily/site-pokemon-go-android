- Your phone might not be connected to an active internet connection.
- Pokemon Go could not have permission to access the location of your device.

## Part 2: How to Fix Pokemon Go No GPS Signal Issue on iOS Devices?

If you own an iOS device and are facing the Pokemon Go GPS bug, then you can follow these troubleshooting tips.

### Fix 1: Enable the Location Services on your Phone

Before taking any drastic measures, make sure that the location services on your iOS device are enabled. You can just go to the Control Center and tap on the GPS icon to turn it on. Alternatively, you can also browse to its Settings > Privacy > Location Services and toggle on this feature.

![enable location services iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon/enable-location-services-iphone.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
After that, you can restart the app and check if it would fix the GPS Pokemon Go issue or not.

### Fix 2: Grant the Pokemon Go app Location Access

Turning on the location services on your iPhone is not enough and you need to grant the GPS access to the Pokemon Go app. To fix the Pokemon Go GPS problem on your iPhone, simply visit its Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Now, from the list of the installed apps, select Pokemon Go and make sure it can access the GPS on your iPhone while running (or always).

### Fix 3: Set Precise Location for Pokemon Go

In case the Pokemon Go GPS is not accurate on your iPhone, then you can enable the “Precise Location” option for the app. This will make sure that Pokemon Go can access the exact location of your phone.

To fix these Pokemon Go GPS issues, you can go to your phone’s Settings > Privacy > Location Services and select Pokemon Go. From the location sharing option, make sure the Precise Location feature is enabled.

### Fix 4: Step Into an Open Area

If you're currently in an area with poor GPS reception due to buildings or trees, try moving to an open area with a clear view of the sky. This can significantly improve your GPS signal strength.

### Fix 5: Restart the App and the Realme Narzo 60 5G device

Lastly, you can just reload the Pokemon Go app or restart your iPhone if you still get the Pokemon Go no GPS signal. You can just go to the app drawer and swipe up the Pokemon Go card to close the app.

## Part 3: How to Fix the Pokemon Go No GPS Signal Issues on Android?

Just like iPhone models, fixing the Pokemon Go GPS problem on Android phones is pretty easy and can be done in the following way:

### Fix 1: Check the Location Services on your phone

Needless to say, the first thing that you should do is to check the location settings on your phone to fix the GPS Pokemon Go problem.

You can just slide down the Control Center and tap on the GPS button to enable the location services. Besides that, you can also go to your phone’s Settings > Locations and turn it on.
