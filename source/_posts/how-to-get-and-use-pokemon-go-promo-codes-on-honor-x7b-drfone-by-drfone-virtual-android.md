## How to Get and Use Pokemon Go Promo Codes On Honor X7b

The steady increase in the number of Pokemon Go users has simultaneously led to the expansion of the software. And such is the use of **Pokemon Go promo codes** and Pokemon promo cards. Pokemon Go promo codes are short-time alphanumeric codes that allow you to receive free in-game items, as Pokemon prize cards are awards that are gifted to the players who can intensely beat the Pokemon and knock it out.

Pokemon promo codes or promo cards elevate your game to a whole new level since you will be able to possess the Poke balls, berries, lucky eggs, incense, and other various loots. They will make your game an absolute breeze, and you necessarily won’t move around as you play. Besides, Pokemon promo codes are short-lasting; you, therefore, need to claim them quickly.

This article gives an insight on how to get and use Pokemon Go promo codes and promo cards.

## Part 1: How to Get Pokemon Go Promo Codes

Pokemon Go often offers promo codes on special events or after successful partnerships.

The availability of Pokemon promo codes is not constant – They do come and go.

Pokemon promo codes are unpredictable, and so are their rewards. Some promo codes will offer exceptional gifts such as cosmetics, while others may be in-game supplies such as Pokeballs and berries.

Niantic shares some free Pokemon Go promo codes on their official Twitter account. Their official statement on the website says, "Niantic offers a limited supply of one-time use codes in conjunction with special events or sponsored partnerships."

Pokemon Go also has daily free boxes, the ones you attain at no additional cost.

To check if you have received your daily free boxes, you need to glimpse at your store on a day-to-day basis.

With your free boxes, you can obtain different items.

## Part 2: The Latest Active Pokemon GO Promo Codes (January 2024)

The latest active **Pokemon Go promo codes** are less in number and are not readily available. However, here is the list of functional and usable Pokemon Go promo codes.

## Part 3: How to Redeem Pokemon Go Promo Codes

With your **Pokemon Go promo code**, you can redeem it to get insightful items such as lucky eggs, poke balls, and lure modules, among others. The Android and iOS mobile phones all have different ways of redeeming the promo codes. Android device is through the app itself, while the iOS device is through the Pokemon Go Niantic official website.

 **Android devices --**

**Step 3. Redeem your promo code**

Hit the **‘Redeem’** icon. A confirmation notification will pop up. It will show all the items you added to your inventory.

## Part 4: How to Cheat at Pokemon Go

The Pokemon Go promo code is not usually available at all times. However, this should not limit your play. You don’t necessarily have to move around for you to catch the Pokemon. You can still enjoy playing Pokemon Go in your comfort. You, therefore, have to involve a third-party tool. And the best software tool to use is Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This tool is an award-winning professional tool that allows you to teleport effortlessly. The key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location are:

- It has instant teleportation. It helps in concealing your GPS location
- It has a full-screen HD map view
- It has a joystick tool that comfortably allows you to spoof your location
- It will enable you to spoof your GRS location with a single click



Faking GPS location in iPhone devices differs from Android devices.

**iPhone devices --**

Here are the simple steps of using Dr. Fone - Virtual Location in faking your location on Pokemon Go on the iPhone.

**Step 1. Launch Dr. Fone Virtual Location to your computer.**

![install dr. fone to start faking gps](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

First, download Dr.Fone - Virtual location from their [<u>official website</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). Install and allow it to run on your computer device. Click on the **‘Virtual Location’** option to initiate the process of faking your GPS.

**Step 2. Link your iPhone to your computer**

![connect your phone and start to change location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

Using a USB cable, connect your iPhone to your computer system. Hit the **‘Get started’** button to continue.

**Step 3. Search for a location**

![search for a location to fake](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

Here, you need to search for a suitable location that you would like to teleport to. Hit the **‘teleport**’ option from the toolbar at the top-right corner of the interface.

**Step 4. Teleport to your desired location**

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

Various options of places you would like to teleport to will be there on display. You can search for it using the search bar or select one from the displayed list and hit the **‘Go’** icon.

**Step 5. Teleport to your chosen location**

For you to teleport to your chosen location, you need to drop a pin on your preferred place and hit the **‘Move Here’** icon. Now, you will be able to catch more Pokemon since you have already altered your location.

![ideal location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-05.png)



**Android Phones --**

Faking location on Android phones is undoubtedly more straightforward than on iPhones. In Android phones, hacking the GPS location does not necessarily involve using a computer device.

Here are the simple steps of how to fake your GPS location on Android devices.

**Step 1.  Enable the developer options**

![enable option to let developer mode be turned on](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-11.jpg)

When you want to fake your location to allow you to play Pokemon Go freely, the first thing to do is unlock your developer options settings.

Go to the **‘Setting’** menu, which is usually at the top right corner of your interface. Scroll down and click on the **‘About Phone.’** Search for the **‘Build number’** option and click on it. Tap the build number about five times until a pop-up notification **‘You are now a developer’** appears.

**Step 2. Download the Fake GPS Location app to your Honor X7b**

![download the fake gps location on your Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-13.jpg)

Go to the Google Play Store and download Fake GPS Location to your Honor X7b. Install it and allow it to run on your Honor X7b.

**Step 3. Allow mock location**

![wa stickers](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokekom-go-teleport-safely-12.jpg)

To get the Mock Location option, you go back to the **‘Settings’** menu. Scroll down search for **‘Allow Mock Locations’** and turn it on when you find it. Allow mocking of the Fake GPS app.

**Step 4. Search for your desired location to fake**

Go to your Fake GPS application and search for a preferred location. To initiate the process, hit the **‘Search’** bar.

**Step 5. Confirm your new location**

![search and confirm your new location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/pokemon-go-fake-gps-android-7.jpg)

Lastly, head back to your Pokemon Go app. There, you can see your new location cast.

### Conclusion

All **Pokemon promo codes** have an expiry time frame. And the time frames are usually shorter. Therefore, you need to use them before their due time elapses. Currently, there are no Pokemon promo codes. And for you to continue playing Pokemon Go, you need to involve a third-party tool, and the best tool to use is Dr. Fone Virtual Location.

## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Honor X7b?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

![iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg)

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

![iOS-App-Store-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg)

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

![VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg)

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account. Here are the simple steps that you need to follow to work with [Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) for spoofing location

## Part 3 - Tips to avoid being Banned

- You need to give enough time for the cool down. This means, as soon as you change your location, wait for a few minutes before you can play the game again so that the ‘vigilante’ does not catch this abrupt change.
- Try not to use apps that are too amateur, having fake reviews on Google/App stores because these will be too vulnerable and detectable.
- If you are not sure where to spoof, then there are certain safe co-ordinates that lon term gamers of Pokemon Go suggest so you can opt for them. They are just for starters until you find your way through
- Try not to make abrupt location changes - keep it nearby initially and slowly try to increase your radius. An abrupt change can draw attention.

![Quick tips-for-no-ban-pic-10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Quick%20tips-for-no-ban-pic-10.jpg)

That being said, there aren’t any well-researched and ground rules as to how your spoofing should be so that you remain undetected. All we can do is pick up tips from someone else’s expertise.
