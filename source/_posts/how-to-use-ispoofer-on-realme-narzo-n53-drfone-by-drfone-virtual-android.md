iSpoofer is one of the most useful tools for iOS users, that’s designed to simulate a user's GPS location. With iSpoofer, you can change your current location to anywhere in the world and access geo-restricted content without any hassle. While the tool has several real-world applications, the majority of users use iSpoofer to fake their location to catch rare Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

Since iSpoofer is an extremely reliable app, even Android users want to know if they can use it on their smartphones or not. If you’re one of them, this guide will help. In today’s article, we are going to discuss if you can download **iSpoofer for Android** or not and what are some of the best solutions to fake GPS location on an Android device.

So, without any further ado, let’s get started.

- [Part 1: Can I download the iSpoofer on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part1)
- [Part 2: Common ways to spoof on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part2)

## ****Part 1:  Can I download the iSpoofer on Android****

Unfortunately, iSpoofer isn’t available for Android. It’s an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won’t be able to download **iSpoofer for Android** at all.

However, the good news is that you don’t need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that’ll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you’ll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.

## ****Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android****

When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you’ll have to be extra cautious. _Why?_ Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren’t reliable and may damage your smartphone’s overall functionality as well.

Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.

1. **Use VMOS**

VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you’ll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you’ll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.

![vmos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg)

The only downside of using VMOS is that it’s extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you’ll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn’t have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.

2. **Root Your Device**

Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you’ll root your device, you won’t be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don’t want to void your smartphone’s warranty, ‘rooting’ may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.

3. **Use PGSharp**

PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to **iSpoofer for Android**. It’s a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick. The best part about using PGSharp is that it’s compatible with all Android devices. You won’t have to root your device to install and run PGSharp.

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

You can either choose the free or the paid version of the app. Of course, the latter comes with a few additional features, but if you only want to fake location in Pokemon Go, the free version of PGSharp will get the job done as well.

**Note:** Keep in mind that PGSharp isn’t available on Google Play Store and you’ll have to download it from the official [<u>PGSharp website</u>](https://www.pgsharp.com/).

## **Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location**

So, that’s how you can fake GPS location on an Android device and collect different types of Pokemon in Pokemon Go. Even though iSPoofer isn’t available for Android, you can still use the above three methods to mock location without any effort.

It’s also worth noting that iSpoofer is permanently shut down and you can no longer install it on iOS devices as well. Even the iSpoofer website is down and if you want to fake location on your iPhone/iPad, you’ll have to look for other options. One of the best ways to change GPS location on an iOS device is to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). It’s a professional geo spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a wide variety of features to mock location on Realme Narzo N53s.

It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that’ll allow you to change your current location to anywhere in the world. You can even set a fake location using its GPS coordinates. Like iSpoofer, [<u>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) also comes with the GPS Joystick feature. This means you’ll be able to catch different types of Pokemon without moving at all.

Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).

- Change your current location with a single click
- Use GPS coordinates to find locations
- Virtually control your GPS movement using the Joystick feature
- Customize your movement speed while walking in different directions
- Compatible with all iOS versions

## Pokémon Go Cooldown Chart On Realme Narzo N53

Pokémon Go is a viral game; hence many people try to cheat to achieve high scores and invade others' privacy. The good news is that the Pokémon company is very responsive to preventing and combating such attacks. Cooldown Pokémon go another such feature to deter cheating. So let us discuss what cooldown means.

What is a cooldown? Cooldown Time restricts to stop a player from repeating multiple actions at different locations in a specified period.

## Part 1: What does Soft Banned & Cooldown Mean?

A soft ban is a restriction to discourage people from playing Pokémon Go while driving or moving. The three primary reasons for getting a soft ban are GPS spoofing, sharing accounts, and traveling fast. A soft ban is a temporary ban triggered when the Pokémon determines that the player cannot arrive within a period. So how do you know if you're soft-banned Pokémon go? A soft ban has some consequences, i.e., wasting tickets, no Pokémon guarding towers, no attacking Pokémon defending towers, etc.

What does cool down mean? Cooldown is the time a player has to wait after completing the in-game action. It is calculated from the distance you travel between the triggering activities. It depends on distance travel, and the time for cooldown is also high when the distance is high.

## Part 2: What Happens When You Get a Soft Ban?

When you get a soft ban, its duration is about 12 hours. In this period, any Pokémon you catch during the ban period will leave even if you use any ball type or berries. It also restricts you from winning gym fights and looting Pokéstops. You can still keep playing Pokémon, though, as it is the most lenient form of ban.

## Part 3: Cooldown Rules and How to Avoid Soft Ban in Pokémon Go?

### 1\. How long does it take for a Pokémon to Cool Down?

The cooldown time is proportional to the distance covered by the player. So, when you perform an action marking our location, the cooldown time starts, and you must wait until the cooldown time is over. Here is a quick review of how long the cooldown you can expect.

| **Total Distance Covered** | **Cooldown Period** |
| --- | --- |
| 1 km | 30 seconds |
| 5 km | 2 minutes |
| 10 km | 6 minutes |
| 25 km | 11 minutes |
| 30 km | 14 minutes |
| 65 km | 22 minutes |
| 81 km | 25 minutes |
| 100 km | 35 minutes |
| 250 km | 45 minutes |
| 500 km | 1 hour |
| 750 km | 1 hour 20 minutes |
| 1000 km | 1 hour 30 minutes |
| \>1500 km | 2 hour |

### 2\. How long must I wait to avoid a softban?

The waiting period for a soft ban is around 12 hours. After this time, if you can try and catch a Pokémon, it means the soft ban is over.

### 3\. Actions that Do trigger cooldown?

The main reasons for a soft ban are GPS spoofing, changing your location to a distant place in a short time, and traveling too fast to combat playing while driving. Sharing accounts is another reason.

So, what action of a player can trigger a cooldown? Let us list them here for quick reference.

- If you catch a wild Pokémon, like the ones coming from Incense, Meltan's Mystery Box،, Lure Modules, and Special Lures.
- Another trigger of the cooldown is dropping the ball on the encounter screen.
- When you feed a wild Pokémon a berry.
- When you feed a gym defender on a screen radar.
- Gym battles.
- When a Pokémon flees, if you try to catch it.

### 4\. Actions that DO NOT trigger cooldown?

On the other hand, some actions that do not trigger a cooldown in Pokémon Go;

- We are encountering a wild Pokémon.
- Feeding a berry to a gym defender remotely.
- Teleporting
- Auto Walking
- Eggs hatching
- Exchanging gifts.
- Pokémon evolution.
- Catching reward Pokémon from quests
- Speed raids but only after a 2-hour Cooldown
- Trading a Pokémon
- Transferring a Pokémon
- Buddy changing
- Using Candies and Stardust to get a second move for a Pokémon
- Incense, Lucky Egg or Starpiece
- Player vs. Player or team leader battles
- Buying a Lure Module or Special Lure at a PokéStop
- Buying coins and shop items
- Pokémon power up
- Speed raids without a 2-hour Cooldown
- Claiming rewards
- Changing your avatar's clothes or items
- Clicking on a gym with an active raid to get a free raid pass
- Finding and catching certain Pokémon from s Smeargle and Party Hat Pikachu
- Dropping a ball

### 5\. What happens if you break the cooldown of Pokémon Go?

When you break the cooldown Pokémon go, you are bound to face a soft ban. How do you know if you're soft-banned Pokémon go? If you attempt to take any action in the game and receive a "Try Again Later" error message, it means you are soft banned.

## Part 4: The Safest Way to Teleport in Pokémon GO Without Getting Banned?

As we already discussed, teleport does not trigger soft ban or cooldown restrictions. So, it is a valid method of moving on without any risks. While location spoofers and using VPNs can be risky, and you may get banned and lose your records, we recommend using a safe application that is Dr.Fone Virtual location, to elevate your game and fun.

Dr. Fone allows you to teleport anywhere in the world along with other unique features, including route simulation, GPS control, and unlimited choices of locations. Also, the new location gets active right away in the game.

It is a very simple-to-use application and provides robust results if you follow the guidelines. You have to make sure that the following best practices are followed, including;

- Always wait for the cooldown period to be over so that the game does not flag your account because of very fast movement and change of location. We have discussed the optimal cooldown time in the above section.
- Always log off from Pokémon before teleporting so the game does not detect your actions. For logging out, go to settings in your game by clicking the Pokeball in the center of the screen. Scroll down to locate and click the logout button.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS/Android) is an easy and reliable teleporting method for Android and iOS. So let us visit how to teleport using this software step by step.

## Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Realme Narzo N53

After the incredible hype of finally getting the chance to battle other players, trainers hit a wall marked – Pokémon Go battle leagues Not Available.

It’s not the first time trainers have experienced bugs in the game and a long wait during maintenance breaks, but patience wears thin as after 2 weeks into the release of the super hyped Battle League, trainers all around the world are yet to have access to it.

The root cause of this disappointing course of events was a major bug in the first season of the Battle League. Some players could simply use “charged moves” repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.

## Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?

Pokémon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer’s experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.

Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.

The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.

Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.

Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.

![pokemon 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg)

Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.

Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;

- **Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –** Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.
- **Fast Attacks are slower on Android –** Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.
- **Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -** Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.
- **Go Battle wins are not counted –** Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.
- **Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball –** A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.
- **Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button –** The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pokémon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.
- **Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen –** After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‘Next Battle’ option disappears from the Post-win screen.

## Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?

It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.

Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.

Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.

The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.

After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.

Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.

![pokemon 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg)

After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.

Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.

Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to. Battle Leagues, since its debut has had 4 seasons till now and trainers are all pumped for Season 5.

Here’s a list of exciting updates that will be included in the upcoming season;

- At Rank 7 you will encounter a Legendary Pokémon on the Go Battle League battle tracks as similar to the Legendary Pokémon encountered in 5star raids.
- To reach Rank 2 a trainer will need to complete a number of Battles in order to progress.
- From Rank 3 all the way to Rank 10, a higher number of battles must be won to proceed.
- Season 5 will be completed once you reach rank 7 which will earn you the Elite Charged TM rather than an Elite Fast TM.
- In Season 5 few Pokémon’s will get new updated move sets which the trainers can use to train and prepare for upcoming tournaments.

## Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?

The basics you need to learn to play Pokémon go is catching Pokémon and powering them up. Other than that there are ways you can speed power up your Pokémon to increase CP to higher levels. The overall Pokémon’s collected, evolved or powered up, and battles fought in Battle League will win you points to level up in Pokémon Go.

Although it might seem like a long and hard journey, it doesn’t need to. You can catch and power up Pokémon faster and cover longer distances with some help from WondershareDr.Fone. With smoother and easier GPS spoofing you can cover Poke stops much quicker.
