## Part 1. What Are the Possible Leagues in Pokémon GO PvP

There are three core leagues in the trainer battles in Pokémon GO, namely Great, Ultra, and Master. Each of these leagues has its own CP limitation and comes in rotation during each season.

**Step 5 –** Go to your computer and type in “PC > Item Storage”.

**Step 6 –** Withdraw a SINGLE Rare Candy

**Step 7 –** check if you have double Rare Candy entries in your storage. If they are not duplicated, then the cheat has worked as it should. If they are duplicated, then you have to close the game and redo all the steps above.

**Step 8 –** Now exit and then go back to your Item Storage, where you can withdraw as many Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candies as you would want. Simply pick a number between 001 and 999, but never use the down arrow.

## In conclusion

Getting Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red is a difficult task. These cadies are not easy to find and they may not be in a location that you can access easily. The article shows you the locations at which you can collect Pokemon Go Fire Red Candy using the normal gameplay. You may also use Pokemon Go GameShark cheat codes and get unlimited Rare Candy to use whenever you need them.
