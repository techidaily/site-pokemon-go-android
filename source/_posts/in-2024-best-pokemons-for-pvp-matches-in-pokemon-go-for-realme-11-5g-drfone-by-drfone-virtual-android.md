## Part 1. What Are the Possible Leagues in Pokémon GO PvP

There are three core leagues in the trainer battles in Pokémon GO, namely Great, Ultra, and Master. Each of these leagues has its own CP limitation and comes in rotation during each season. So, you have to learn to battle in each of them to get seamless rewards. Let's look at each of these leagues individually for a better understanding of the **best Pokémon for PvP**.

![pokemon pvp battles](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/02/everything-to-know-about-pvp-2.jpg)

### 1\. Great League

The Great League is the easiest league to jump into for beginners. Here, only Pokémon with 1,500 CP or less can join the battle. This low CP cap makes Pokémon with lower maximum CP shine, like Azumarill and Altaria. These Pokémon might not stand out in the other leagues, but in the Great League, they can dominate the battlefield.

### 2\. Ultra League

The next league that comes is Ultra League, which raises the CP cap to 2,500. Legendary Pokémon start making appearances here, with a focus on defensive power. Pokémon like Registeel and Cresselia excel in this league, but there are also many other Pokémon that hold their own valuable potential.

In the same way, Venusaur with Frenzy Plant and Swampert with Hydro Cannon are also popular choices in this league.

### 3\. Master League

The Master League removes all CP limits, allowing any Pokémon to jump into the action. Here, Trainers tend to lean towards Pokémon with high maximum CP. Pokémon like Groudon and Origin Forme Giratina are notable here, making them fit for any kind of battle.

Surprisingly, some Pokémon are not commonly picked for Raids, like Dialga and Altered Forme Giratina. However, they are powerful competitors and key contributors to the Master League.

## Part 2. What Is the Strongest Pokémon To Use in Each Pokémon GO PvP League?

As you already must know, there are various Pokémon with their own individual CP cap. To battle in a PvP league, you must choose Pokémon that fall under the CP cap of that league. In this section, we will discuss the strongest and **best Pokémon for PvP Pokémon GO**:
