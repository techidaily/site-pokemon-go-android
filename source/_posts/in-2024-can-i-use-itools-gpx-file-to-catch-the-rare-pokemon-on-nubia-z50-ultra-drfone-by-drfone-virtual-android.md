- Step 3: Set Your Destination Through Routes (If Required)

Go back to the top-right section and pick either the "One-Stop Route" or "Multi-Stop Route" feature. Alternatively, you can also use the joystick to guide yourself to the destination. After teleporting, just tap any spot on the map as your destination.

- Step 4: Start the Simulation To Spoof the GPS

Once you've set your destination, decide if you want a "Round Trip" or "Loop Trip." Then, set the number of repetitions and control the speed with the slider. Finally, click on "Move Here" to initiate the simulation and see your virtual movement. If you want to pause or return to your original location, use the "Pause" or "Clear" buttons.

2. **Assign Roles to Each Pokémon:**Once you have made a team, designate a lead Pokémon to set the tempo of the battle. Plus, always keep a safe switch Pokémon for unfavorable situations. A good strategy is to use closer Pokémon for end-game scenarios, ensuring they can withstand attacks and deal significant damage.
