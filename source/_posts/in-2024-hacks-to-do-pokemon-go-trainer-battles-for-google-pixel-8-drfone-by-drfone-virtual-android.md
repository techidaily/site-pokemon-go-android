Launch [Wondershare Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/phone-switch/) - Virtual Location and connect your phone to the PC or MacBook. After connecting, navigate to the upper right and choose "Teleport Mode" by clicking on the initial icon.

- Step 3: Set Your Destination Through Routes (If Required)

Go back to the top-right section and pick either the "One-Stop Route" or "Multi-Stop Route" feature. Alternatively, you can also use the joystick to guide yourself to the destination. After teleporting, just tap any spot on the map as your destination.

- Step 4: Start the Simulation To Spoof the GPS

Once you've set your destination, decide if you want a "Round Trip" or "Loop Trip." Then, set the number of repetitions and control the speed with the slider. Finally, click on "Move Here" to initiate the simulation and see your virtual movement. If you want to pause or return to your original location, use the "Pause" or "Clear" buttons.
