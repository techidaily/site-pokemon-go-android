## How Do You Get Sun Stone Evolutions in Pokémon For Realme C67 4G?

![pokémon go sun stone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions.jpg)

Though you can certainly catch some powerful Pokémon in Pokémon Go just by playing the game, exploring the wilderness, and joining raids, it’s not enough. Evolving your Pokémon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.

Now, while some of your Pokémon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pokémon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive – one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.

**Pokémon Go Sun Stone evolutions** can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.

## Part 1. What Are Sun Stones in Pokémon Go?

![sun stone and four pokémon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-2.jpg)

The Sun Stone is one of eight evolution items you’ll need in Pokémon Go. Glowing bright red and orange, it is effortless to recognize in the game, immediately catching your eye even in the busiest of environments. Consider yourself lucky if you come across one casually.

Evolutions in Pokémon Go aren’t always the same. You’ll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pokémon. Depending on the species, you’ll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don’t worry, evolutions don’t affect the total number of Pokémon in your collection).

Depending on the specific Pokémon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).

You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.

## Part 3. Which Pokémon Evolve With Sun Stones?

![sunken and sunflora in pokémon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-4.jpg)

Every Pokémon you come across in the game is different, and they’ll all have varying evolution requirements. Considering how elusive the Sun Stone can be, it’s great that only a few Pokémon require it. Check out the following Pokémon Sun Stone evolution list.

### Pokémon Sun Stone Evolution List

| **Pokémon** | **Items Needed** | **Sun Stone Evolutions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gloom | Sun Stone and 100 Oddish candy | Bellossom |
| Sunkern | Sun Stone and 50 Sunkern candy | Sunflora |
| Cottonee | Sun Stone and 50 Cottonee candy | Whimsicott |
| Petilil | Sun Stone and 50 Petilil candy | Lilligant |
| Helioptile | Sun Stone and 50 Helioptilecandy | Heliolisk |

## Part 4. How to Acquire Sun Stones on Pokémon Go

![sun stone and helioptile in pokémon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-5.jpg)

While certainly not the rarest evolution item in Pokémon Go, that title belonging to the ever-elusive Axew's Unova Stone, the Sun Stone will still make you work for it. Only the lucky few are able to come across it randomly, as it comes with a mere 1% drop chance.

Fortunately, for all those unlucky ones, you can acquire the Sun Stone to complete your Pokémon evolutions in a few different ways.

### Special Events

Partaking in Pokémon Go special events is almost always a lucrative experience. You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pokémon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pokémon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:

- Lunar New Year – February 5 to February 11;
- Carnival of Love – February 13 to February 15;
- Road to Sinnoh – February 19 to February 23.

You’ll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a Sun Stone, there’s always a possibility!

### Field Research

Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pokémon, so he’ll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.

Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.

As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.

### Special Research

With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.

Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.

As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.

### Gyms and PokeStops

Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.

While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.

Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.

## Part 5. How to Gather Sun Stones Efficiently

![Text” sun stone in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-6.jpg)

Field research, special research, and spinning gyms and PokéStops are the only ways you could acquire the Sun Stone in Pokémon Go. However, that doesn’t mean you’ll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.

### Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly

Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.

To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you’ll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.

Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.

You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.

To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:

1. Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;
2. Connect your phone to your computer;
3. Go to **Toolbox > Virtual Location > Get Started**;

![get started with wondershare dr.fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

4. On the map that shows up, click on **No Device**in the upper right-hand corner;
5. You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;

![choose the Realme C67 4G device you want to connect to dr.fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png)

6. On your phone, tap **Allow USB Debugging**;
7. On your phone, go to **Developer Options> Select mock location app**;
8. Select **Fone**.

![set up mock location on your phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png)

From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement. With Wondershare Dr.Fone, you’ll have intuitive keyboard controls, 360-degree directions, and automated movement. So, as soon as you set things up in the app, you can start playing the game, completing your field research tasks, and, hopefully, acquiring your Sun Stones.

### Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events

Finally, to start getting Sun Stones and other rarer items more efficiently, you’ll always want to pay close attention to community days and special events. Pokémon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you’ll always want to know precisely when they start and end.

Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pokémon Go on social media or visit the official Pokémon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.

## Conclusion

Acquiring Sun Stones for Pokémon evolutions can be quite a hassle. This rare evolution item can be a tricky find. Still, simply playing the game and joining all events, completing your research tasks, and more can significantly increase your chances of coming across a Sun Stone – especially if you have the help of apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone.

## The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Realme C67 4G

In all Pokemon Go versions, a Rare Candy will automatically uplift you to the next level. These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.

## Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?

All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.

There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.

When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.

**Step 5 –** Go to your computer and type in “PC > Item Storage”.

**Step 6 –** Withdraw a SINGLE Rare Candy

**Step 7 –** check if you have double Rare Candy entries in your storage. If they are not duplicated, then the cheat has worked as it should. If they are duplicated, then you have to close the game and redo all the steps above.

**Step 8 –** Now exit and then go back to your Item Storage, where you can withdraw as many Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candies as you would want. Simply pick a number between 001 and 999, but never use the down arrow.
