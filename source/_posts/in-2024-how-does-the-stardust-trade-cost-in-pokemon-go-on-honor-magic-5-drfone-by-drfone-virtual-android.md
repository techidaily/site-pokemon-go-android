Ingress Prime is best suited for players who like the concept of playing Pokémon Go but for those who want a different storyline. In this game, you also explore different worlds based on the location that they track you in and you interact with different worlds. When you play, you will be asked to choose between two teams, the Resistance and the Enlightened, which will show you different options on how to play the game.
