## How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Realme 11 5G?

Pokémon Go is a location-based AR game and is very popular in the world of gaming. Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.

**Secondly, Punishment:** On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.

However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pokémon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.
