## How to Come up With the Best Pokemon Team On Honor X50i+?

If you have been playing Pokemon games (like Sun/Moon or Sword/Shield), then you must be familiar with their team building. To succeed, players are encouraged to create teams of their Pokemons that they have to use to complete missions. Though, it might take a while to master how you create a winning team. To help you, I have come up with some smart tips that would let you come up with some amazing Pokemon teams.

![Pokemon Team Building Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What are Some Good Pokemon Team Examples?

To understand the dynamics of team composition, you should know that there are ideally different kinds of Pokemons:

- Sweeper: These Pokemons are mostly used to attack as they can do a lot of damage and even move swiftly. Though, they have low defense stats and can be of a physical or special type.
- Tanker: These Pokemons have high defense stats and can take a lot of damage. Though, they have slow movement and low attacking stats.
- Annoyer: They are known for their fast movement and while their damage might not be so high, they can annoy your opponents.
- Cleric: These are supportive Pokemons that are mostly used to heal or boost the stats of other Pokemons.
- Drainer: These are also supportive Pokemons, but they can drain the stats of your opponents while healing your team.
- Wall: These are tougher than tank Pokemons and can take a substantial amount of damage from sweepers.

![hola free vpn](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-4.jpg)

Based on these different types of Pokemons, you can come up with the following teams to win your next battle:

### 1\. 2x Physical Sweeper, 2x Special Sweeper, Tanker, and Annoyer

If you want to have an attacking team, then this would be the perfect combination. While the annoyer and tanker would drain the HP of the opponents, your sweeper Pokemons can finish them with their high attacking stats.

### 2\. 3x Sweepers (Physical/Special/Mixed), Tanker, Wall, and Annoyer

This is one of the most balanced Pokemon teams that would work in almost every situation. In this, we have a tanker and a wall to take damage from the opponent’s Pokemon. Also, we have three different types of sweepers to do maximum damage.

![Balanced Pokemon Teams](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-3.jpg)

### 3\. Drainer, Tanker, Cleric, and 3 Sweepers (Physical/Special/Mixed)

In some situations (when there are lots of sweepers in the opponent’s team), this team would excel. Your support Pokemons (drainers and clerics) would boost the HP of sweepers while the tanker would take the damage.

### 4\. Rayquaza, Arceus, Dialga, Kyogre, Palkia, and Groudon

This is one of the most legendary teams in Pokemon that any player can have. The only issue is catching these legendary Pokemons can take a lot of time and effort, but it would certainly be worth it.

### 5\. Garchomp, Decidueye, Salazzle, Araquanid, Metagross, and Weavile

Even if you don’t have a lot of experience in the game, you can try this power-packed team in Pokemon games like Sun and Moon. It has the perfect balance of attacking and defensive Pokemons that would excel in every situation.

## Part 2: Things to Consider while Creating your Pokemon Team

Since there could be so many ways for coming up with a Pokemon team, I would recommend following these suggestions:

### Tip 1: Consider your strategy

The most important thing that you need to know is the overall strategy that you have to focus on game. For instance, at times, players would like to play defensively while others want to focus on attacking. Therefore, you can come up with a team composition according to your needs.

### Tip 2: Try to attain a balanced team

Needless to say, if you have all attacking or all defensive Pokemons in your team, then you might not get the desired results. That’s why it is recommended to have a mixed bag of sweepers, healers, tankers, annoyers, etc. in your team.

### Tip 3: Don’t pick Pokemons with common weaknesses

It is always recommended to have a diverse team so that your opponent can’t harass you. For instance, if two or more Pokemons have the same type of weakness, then your opponent can easily win by counter-picking Pokemons.

### Tip 4: Practice and alter your team

Even if you have a decent team, it doesn’t mean that it would excel in all scenarios. It is always recommended to keep practicing with your team every now and team. Also, feel free to edit your team by swapping Pokemons. We have discussed how to edit Pokemon teams in the next section.

### Fix 5: Research and pick rare Pokemons

Most importantly, keep looking up for Pokemon team suggestions by experts online and via other Pokemon-related communities. Also, a lot of players suggest picking rare or legendary Pokemons as they have limited weaknesses, making them harder to be countered.

## Part 3: How to Edit your Pokemon Team in the Game?

Ideally, you can come up with all kinds of teams in Pokemon games. Though, there are times when we simply wish to edit the team according to different situations. This can easily be done by visiting your Pokemon team in the game.

The overall interface would largely vary on the game that you are playing. Let’s take the example of Pokemon Sword and Shield. At first, you can just go to the interface and select your team. Now, select the Pokemon of your choice and from the provided options, click on “Swap Pokemon”. This will provide a list of the available Pokemons that you can browse and choose a Pokemon to swap with.

![Swap Pokemon in a Team](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/how-to-build-pokemon-team-5.jpg)

There you go! By following these tips, you would be able to come up with a winning Pokemon team for different games. I have included various examples of Pokemon team combinations here that you can also apply. Besides that, you can also follow the above-listed tips to create different styles of amazing teams in Pokemon games like Sword/Shield or Sun/Moon like a pro.

## Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Honor X50i+

According to the original gameplay, you need to be physically present on the battleground to catch the Pokémon. It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.

The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to [spoof Pokémon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html). But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.

There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.

In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.

## Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned

The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.

![pokemon go ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg)

The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:

- Engaging in harassment against any player in the game
- Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go
- Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo
- Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations

If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.

## Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp

Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.

Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.

Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.

### 2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban

To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.

Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.

![pgsharp plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg)

To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg)

Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg)

Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.

The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.

Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.

### 2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp

There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.

But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.

## Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?

Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg)

Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.

## Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?

Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to fake location. It is easy to use and easy to install. Further, this app is 100% safe to install on the iPhone as it causes no threat to your device or data.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also saves you from a ban and doesn’t require jailbreaking the Honor X50i+ device. You can teleport to any location with it in seconds. Wondersahare specially designed it for iOS users and Android users, but the Pokemon GPS cheat is not available on Android.

To use it, you will need to install it on your device from the official site or click the "_Try It Free_" button below directly. Once installed, connect your Honor X50i+ to your computer and click on get the started icon. Now you have the world map-like interface where you can search for any desired location to spoof. So, all in all, it is very easy to use for a novice too. The best part is that it causes no ban like other unsafe spoofing apps.
