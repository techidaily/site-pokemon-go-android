## 3 Ways for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing On Honor Play 7T

Pokemon Go is one of the most popular gaming apps of the present times, which is based on augmented reality. Developed by Niantic for iOS and Android, this single console game lets us catch all sorts of Pokemons in different areas. Though, to catch Pokemons, users are expected to visit different places and step out. Needless to say, it restricts the scope to [catch Pokemons](https://www.virtuallocation.com/pokemon-go/best-pokemon-type.html), and users often look for Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android. This would let you change your location and [spoof Pokemon Go on Android](https://www.virtuallocation.com/android-location/) pretty easily.

In this guide, I will teach you how to use reliable Android Pokemon Go spoof apps and the risks related to them.

![Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?

Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.

If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.

## Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020

A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android's features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.

- If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won't sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.
- The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.
- The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.

## Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing

As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let's explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.

### 3.1 Use a VPN

A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.

Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here's how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.

**Step 1.** Install Pokemon Go on your Honor Play 7T and create your account if you haven't already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.

**Step 2.** Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can't detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.

**Step 3.** Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Honor Play 7T device again and access the new location.

### 3.2 Use Fake GPS Go

If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Honor Play 7T device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Honor Play 7T and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your phone's Settings > System > About Phone and tap on the "Build Number" option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.

![Fake GPS Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Honor Play 7T device's Settings > Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device's location.

![select Fake GPS Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg)

**Step 3.** That's it! Once Fake GPS Go has the needed access, you can just launch the application and manually change your location. Afterward, launch Pokemon Go to access your new location.

![launch Pokemon Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-6.jpg)

If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won't detect its presence. Don't worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.

### 3.3 Use Fake GPS Free

This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won't access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your device's settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.

**Step 2.** Once the app is installed, go to Settings > Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.

![grant Fake GPS access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-7.jpg)

**Step 3.** Afterward, launch the Fake GPS Free application on your device and look for any desired location. You can also manually zoom in or out the map to mark your new location.

**Step 4.** Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.

## Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Honor Play 7T

According to the original gameplay, you need to be physically present on the battleground to catch the Pokémon. It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.

The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to [spoof Pokémon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html). But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.

There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.

In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.

## Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned

The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.

![pokemon go ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg)

The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:

- Engaging in harassment against any player in the game
- Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go
- Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo
- Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations

If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.

## Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp

Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.

Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.

Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.

### 2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban

To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.

Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.

![pgsharp plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg)

To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg)

Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg)

Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.

The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.

Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.

### 2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp

There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.

But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.

## Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?

Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg)

Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.

## Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?

Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to fake location. It is easy to use and easy to install. Further, this app is 100% safe to install on the iPhone as it causes no threat to your device or data.
