## Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Honor X9b

According to the original gameplay, you need to be physically present on the battleground to catch the Pokémon. It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.

The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to [spoof Pokémon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html). But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.

There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.

In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.

## Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned

The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.

![pokemon go ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg)

The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:

- Engaging in harassment against any player in the game
- Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go
- Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo
- Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations

If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.

## Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp

Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.

Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.

Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.

### 2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban

To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.

Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.

![pgsharp plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg)

To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg)

Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg)

Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.

The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.

Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.

### 2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp

There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.

But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.

## Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?

Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg)

Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.

## Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?

Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android.

However, keep in mind that you’re simultaneously doing two different tasks in this regard. One is streaming, and the other is playing. Therefore, ensure your mobile device and internet connection can handle heavy workloads as such. A smartphone with 8 GB RAM (or higher) and an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps is highly recommended.

### Choose a live-streaming application and create an account

![streaming platform](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-4.JPG)

Pick the best one, and then create your Pokemon Go streaming account. Optimize your profile and make sure that the details are complete.
