## How to Use Pokémon Emerald Master Ball Cheat On Realme GT Neo 5 SE

One of the main goals of playing Pokémon is getting as many Pokémon as you can, training and evolving them so you can defeat any opposing trainers, and get to the top of the winning charts.

However, these Pokémon characters can be a little difficult to catch, especially in the wild. When you lob a Pokéball at a Pokémon, there are chances that it could escape.

What if there was a way in which you could catch a Pokémon creature every time, even Legendary Pokémon?

The Pokémon emerald master ball can do this with no effort on your part. Simply activate the ball and the Pokémon is captured. This makes the emerald Pokémon master ball a very important asset. In this article, you get to know all the Pokémon master ball cheat codes that you can use to get these valuable assets.

_**Tips:** Catch Pokémon like a Pro with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location! Capture as many Pokémon as possible within a short time, no matter where they appear. Explore different locations virtually and become a Pokémon-catching master! Try it now!_

## Part 1: Do you know the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball?

![The best ball to catch Pokémon – Pokémon emerald Master Raid Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-emerald-ball.jpg)

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball is a unique Pokéball that is used to capture Pokémon creatures without fail. It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.

The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.

The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.

## Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.

The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.

**958D8046  
A7151D70  
8BB602F7  
8CEB681A.**

All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.

If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.

You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.

When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:  
**82005274 0001**

You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”. Now set it to “autodetect” and you will be able to get Pokémon Master Emerald Balls at any time you wish.

## Part 3: How do you get unlimited master balls in Pokémon Emerald?

There are ways in which you can get unlimited Pokémon Master Balls using the Pokémon emerald Master Ball cheat codes available today.

![Enter PokeMart to but Pokémon Emerald Master Balls](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-4.jpg)

Only one Master Ball can be bought at a time, but you can do this as many times as you want. If you are already inside the PokeMart when you enter the code, you may have to walk out and walk back in again for it to work.

![Buy as many Pokémon Emerald Master Balls as you would like using the cheat code](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-5.jpg)

When you have shopped for Pokémon Emerald Master Balls to your fill, you need to disable the code so your store can go back to normal. All you have to do is go back to the “Cheat List” window and then uncheck the two little lines of Pokémon Emerald Master ball cheat codes.

The best thing about this method is that you do not need to enter another master ball cheat code in the future. All you have to do is go back to your Cheat List and check the box for the code once more.

## Part 4: Other tips to level up on Pokémon go

When you need to level up on Pokémon Go, the best and legal way is to get as much XP as possible within the shortest time possible. Now there are very many ways in which you can amass XP but we shall look at some of the best and easiest ways to go about this.

Here are a few of the best ways to go about this:

### Mass Friending

Having a lot of friends is not what gets you XP, but the quality of friends that you have. Here is what you get from having high-quality friends.

- 3,000 XP for a Great Friend
- 50,000 XP for an Ultra Friend
- 100,000 XP for a Best Friend

Timing the way your friendship levels up, and then dropping a Lucky Egg will hugely boost your XP. However, you can only use this process once for every friend per day. This method is great but it would take you 3 months for any friend to become a Best Friend.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Mass Raids

Raiding Gyms can get you a lot of XP. This is more so when you go for Legendary Raids. You can get up to 10,000 XP for getting into a Legendary Raid. This becomes 20,000 XP if you have a Lucky Egg and 40,000 XP if you use a double XP event together with a Lucky Egg.

**How do you go about this?**

- Add up your stockpile of Premium Raid Passes
- Join a local Raid group through Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, or other social networks that they use.
- Fix up a Raid Train, which is the process of moving from one Raid to another as a group, and this allows you to Raid as much as possible in a short time.

Do as many of these Raids as you can.

### Mass catching and Mass evolving

You can also catch as many Pokémon as you can and then use a Lucky Egg and their Candies to evolve them at the same time. This requires that you evolve many Similar Pokémon and they should be cheap to evolve. You can get a lot of XP in this way.

But how do you catch as many Pokémon as possible within a short time?

This is where teleporting tools such as [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) comes in.

## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Realme GT Neo 5 SE

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your iPhone location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

![ispoofer not working](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-not-working.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Spoof your Realme GT Neo 5 SE Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?
