Needless to say, there are times when players are not able to go outside to catch Pokemons due to all kinds of reasons.

## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.
- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

## Part 3: How to Fake GPS in Pokemon Go: 3 Foolproof Solutions

Out of all the Pokemon Go joystick and location spoofing solutions, I would recommend trying the following tools.

### 3.1 Pokemon Go Joystick for iOS (No Jailbreak Needed)

If you are looking for a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS solution, then just give [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) a try. Without the need for jailbreaking your device, you can spoof your iPhone’s location to anywhere you like. The application can also be used to simulate its movement between multiple spots at a preferred speed.

Besides that, you can also mark any location as favorite or even import/export GPX files using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location. Since the application is extremely easy to use, you don’t have to go through any technical hassle to implement this Pokemon Go joystick iOS solution.

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone and launch the application**

Firstly, you can just connect your iOS device to the computer and launch Dr.Fone – Virtual Location application. You can agree to its terms of services and click on the “Get Started” button now.

![virtual location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Spoof your iPhone Location to Anywhere you want**

Once your iPhone is connected, its present location would automatically be displayed on the screen. To spoof the Pokemon Go location on iOS, select the “Teleport Mode” option and enter the target location’s address/name/coordinates on the search bar.

**Step 3: Simulate the iPhone Movement with a joystick**

To use the Pokemon Go joystick iOS solution, you can select the One-stop or Multi-stop mode from the top. Now, you can drop the pins on the map as per your requirements to set up a route to cover.

### 3.2 Use a Pokemon Go Joystick APK for Android Devices

Just like iPhone, Android device owners can also implement these Pokemon Go hacks for location spoofing. From all the available options, you can consider using GPS Joystick by App Ninjas. As the name suggests, the app will enable a GPS joystick that you can use to simulate the movement of your device. It will let you fake GPS on Pokemon Go by entering the target coordinates or its address.

**Step 1: Install the Pokemon Go Spoofer APK**

To start with, you can just go to the Play Store page of the GPS Joystick app and install it on your device. Later, you can enable the Developer Options on the phone by going to its Settings > About Phone and tapping the “Build Number” field 7 times.

![GPS Joystick Android Install](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg)

Afterward, go to its Settings > Developer Options and set the Pokemon Go spoofer APK the default mock location app.

**Step 2: Set up the preferences to fake GPS on Pokemon Go**

Great! Now all you need to do is launch the GPS Joystick app and go to its Settings to spoof your location. Here, you can enter the exact coordinates of the target location to spoof.

![GPS Joystick Enter Coordinates](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg)

Besides that, you can also tap on the map option to directly enter the address or the name of the target location.

![pokemon go joystick](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-5.jpg)

You can further visit the GPS Joystick settings to set up preferred walking, jogging, or running speeds for the simulated movement.

![GPS Joystick Set Speed](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-6.jpg)

### 3.3 Pokemon Go Joystick Hack for Rooted Android Phones

Lastly, if you have a rooted Android device, then you can also explore tons of options to fake GPS on Pokemon Go. One of them FGL Pro, which is mostly used by experts for location spoofing and movement simulation. Since the Pokemon Go APK download is available for free, you can use the app without any issue. Here’s how you can use this Pokemon Go APK for rooted devices.

**Step 1: Install the Pokemon Go Spoofer APK**

At first, make sure that your Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G is rooted before you install this Pokemon Go APK hack. Later, you can go to its website or any third-party installer to get the location spoofer app.

You can now launch the application and go to its Settings to enable the Root Mode. Also, make it the default mock location app by visiting the Developer Option on your phone.

## Part 4: Tips to Avoid your Pokemon Go Account from Getting Banned

If you want to avoid getting your account banned and still use a reliable spoofing app for Pokemon Go, then consider the following tips:

- Try not to overly use the Pokemon Go joystick app all the time. It is recommended to use these apps 2-3 times a day only.
- Always consider the cooldown duration in mind before changing your location. For instance, avoid using the app for a while before moving from one place to another. If you move from London to Tokyo to New York the same day, then your account might get flagged.
- Try to spoof your location in the same district or state first and wait for a few hours before changing your whereabouts. The following cooldown duration chart would help you determine this in advance.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Chart](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/pokemon-go-joystick-10.jpg)

- Make sure that the Pokemon Go joystick you are using is a reliable solution (like the ones listed above).
- If you have already got a warning on your Pokemon Go account, then consider creating another account for using any fake GPS Pokemon Go hack instead.

There you go! By now, you would be able to implement these spoofing Pokemon Go tips and tricks. As you can see, there can be so many Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solutions that you can explore. While there are plenty of Pokemon Go spoofer APK tools for Android devices, iOS users can try [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). Without the need for jailbreaking your device, it will let you spoof its location and even simulate its movement to catch Pokemons remotely.

## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your iPhone location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

![ispoofer not working](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-not-working.jpg)

### How to find rare Pokémon or complete your Pokédex?

There are various options you can try to find rare Pokémon and complete your Pokedex.

- **Increase your trainer level.** The higher your trainer level is, the higher your chances of finding a rare Pokémon are. So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pokémon.
- **Trade with other players.** If you have friends who also play Pokémon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pokémon with them. Just make sure you’re in a specific range with them.
- **Use incense and lures.** Both of these will help you attract more Pokémon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.
- **Play on the Community Days.** If you’re looking to catch a Shiny Pokémon, don’t forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!
- **Have friends in other regions.** You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pokémon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pokémon with each other.
- **Use a virtual GPS at home.** If you don’t have anyone to trade your regional Pokémon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pokémon!

Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pokémon. Are you ready to complete your Pokedex faster?

### Play Pokémon Go with a Joystick for iOS trainers

Get better control over your [GPS movement on your iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-gps-location-ios.html) by using the joystick feature of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location. This feature can be easily accessed on the main screen of the map. You can either access it from the toolbar located near the top right corner or the lower left side of the screen. 360-degree directions are available. You can move forward or backward by clicking the Up or Down arrows. Keyboard shortcuts W, A, S, and D can be used to control GPS movements, as can Up, Down, Left, and Right keys.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location offers two ways to use the joystick for seamless GPS movement. You can use the Automatic or Manual GPS movement. Here’s how you can use both ways.

### Automatic GPS Movement

- Step 1. Click on the red start button on the joystick near the lower left corner of the screen. It will activate automatic GPS movement.
- Step 2. Now, use the arrows around the button to change your direction or the spot around the circle.
- Step 3. You can also use keyboard keys like A and D, and left and right keys.

### Manual GPS movement

- Step 1. For this method, constantly click on the joystick arrows to move on the map manually.
- Step 2. Alternatively, you can use the W, S, Up, and Down keys on keyboards to change directions manually.
