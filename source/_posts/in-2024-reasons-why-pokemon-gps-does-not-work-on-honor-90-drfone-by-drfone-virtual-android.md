The logic behind the Pokemon Go Routes is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember about it. First, you can record a walking path anywhere and submit it for review. Your Route will immediately appear on the Pokemon Go map once it receives approval from the game developer.

Do you want to try Pokemon Go Routes now? Here’s a quick guide for you on how to access it on your mobile device.
