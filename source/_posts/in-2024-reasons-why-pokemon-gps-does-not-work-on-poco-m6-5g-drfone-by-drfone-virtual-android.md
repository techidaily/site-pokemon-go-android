## How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Poco M6 5G

The main goal that the designers of Pokémon Go had in mind for the past few years was to create a framework that prompts players to get off their loungers and go into the real world in search of Pokémon. If you are wondering why there are certain types of Pokémon enlisted as ‘blanks’ in your Pokedex and you haven’t yet found them, it’s probably because they are marked as ‘regional’ types. This means that these Pokémon are exclusively locked in select regions around the world. Don’t Panic! You don’t have to spend a boat load of cash in order to catch these special regional Pokémon as there are tricks you can apply to catch them without even stepping out of your kitchen.

## Part 1: List of the regional Pokémon that have been announced

Since the game publishers released these special regional Pokémon, they have been locked in their geo-specific locations around the world. There is a set or pair of regional Pokémon for each generation that has been introduced into the game. Regions may not be defined by real-time borders but are divided according to the type of the Pokémon and the place they are more likely to spawn.

These places may be specific to countries (Tauros spawn in the US), specific to a continent (Mr.Mime Spawn in Europe), specific to a region (Corsola spawn in the Tropics), and even certain halves of the planet (Lunastone and Solrock spawn in the Southern half and Northern half of the equator, respectively). These Pokémon are not necessarily rare spawn types. If you are traveling in their region, they may pop up quite frequently. You should take note that regional Pokémon won’t become available in Gyms or in Nests since they will only spawn in the wild. However, you can yet find them through eggs but only in their specific regions.

There are some exceptions among the regionals as well. These exceptions are known to swap their spawn locations or drop out of regional exclusivities like Zangoose and Seviper, or Minun and Plusle. Some regional Pokémon may also turn up in special in-game events like how Farfetch’d spawned during the 2017 Pokémon Go Travel Challenge.

If you are not a frequent traveler or know fellow trainers who are willing to trade their regional Pokémon then you may need to be patient and follow a few extra steps in order to get your hands on these rare types of Pokémon.

List of different Regional Pokémon – Where and How to Catch them All!

As of now, there are over 40 different regional Pokémon divided across generations that can be captured or hatched only in specific expanses of the world. There are of course occasional overlaps of Pokémon slipping out of their region and into other sectors. Let’s get into the list of all the region-specific Pokémon of different generations and where to find them.

## Part 2: How to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location to catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regionally exclusive Pokémon requires you to travel to that location or region where the Pokémon is located, as it was originally intended by the game. Remember that Pokémon Go functions by tracking your location via GPS. Your GPS however, is a virtual means of tracking your IP address which can be faked using the right mock GPS and VPN. You can use a mock virtual location to fake your actual location and make it seem like you’re traveling around the world. The game itself would be tricked, allowing you to travel to regions and get your hands on those geo-exclusive Pokémon.

To get the best out of your mock location and also to avoid the risk of hitting a light ban on your account, [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) by Wondershare has been reviewed as a Mock GPS you can easily rely on. It offers a number of features that can come in handy while faking your location such as adjusting the speed so that it may seem like you’re actually traveling, you can use a 360-degree virtual joystick for manual control over your movements and you can also select specific routes on the map on which you want your in-game avatar to move on.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

You can follow these easy steps to set up and access your Dr.Fone Virtual Location in an instant and teleport to anywhere in the world.

**Step 1: Download the Program**

Download Dr.Fone – Virtual Location. Install and launch the program. Click ‘Virtual Location’ to get access to the options window.

## Part 3: Tips to help catch Regional Pokémon

Catching regional Pokémon is just like catching any regular Pokémon. When they spawn near your location, you catch it by throwing a Poke ball at it. If the Poke ball is seen shaking, it means that the Pokémon is resisting and may just pop out from the ball in which case you may have to throw another one at it. Now, if you are traveling and you have limited time or a number of spawns then here are a few tips you can utilize to enhance your chances of landing a catch.

- **Curve Ball:** Practice your curveball throws. Throwing a curve ball automatically increases your chances of preventing a Pokémon from slipping through your hands, plus you also get a 17x bonus with each successful curve catch.
- **Maximize your Medals:** Medals increase your performance in the game without costing you any extra resources like Great balls, Ultra Balls, or Razz Balls. So, try and max out your medals to increase your chances of catching rare Pokémon, especially the exclusive ones.
- **Keep Consistent:** The algorithm of the game is quite complex but eventually, a pattern emerges. You will notice that if you keep practicing with great or excellent catches with the smaller (low XP) Pokémon, it increases your chances of catching the ones that put up a fight.
- **Save your Berries:** Feeding a Pokémon with Razz Berries increases your assurances of catching the Pokémon while also giving you a 15x bonus when you land a successful catch. Save your berries for those persistent Pokémon spawns.
- **Use Powerful Poke balls:** Last but definitely not least, use powerful balls like the Great Ball or Ultra Ball to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon. You should also remember that these are diminishable resources so use them wisely. On catching a Pokémon with a Great ball you will get 15x and with an Ultra ball you would get 2x so utilize them accordingly to catch rare and super rare Pokémon.

## Conclusion

The journey to completing your Pokedex may not be a short one as there are hundreds of Pokémon out there, and even hundreds more yet to be introduced into the game. Traveling the world in search of the rarest regional Pokémon is meant to be a fun and exciting experience, yet it may not be viable for some who wish to enjoy the game to the fullest. Utilizing a fake GPS and VPN can bridge the gaps in your Pokedex and keep the game fun for you at the same time. So keep playing and catching Pokémon as there are loads of other exciting installments yet to be introduced by Niantic in the future.

### Use Virtual Location to catch the Pokémon Go creature

You can use the faux location of [Dr. Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to imitate your orientation without making a move and collect exclusive Pokémon. The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.

**Step 1: Install:**

Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2: Connect:**

Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:**

Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.

![virtual location 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:**

To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.

![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.

![virtual location 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.

To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the 'March' button. You will be required to do the Pokémon Go walking illusion at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual movement imitation application eases your life and lets you do the job without being concerned about travel costs.

## Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pokémon Go?

Meltan is a legendary steel-type Pokémon that was initially launched in Pokémon Go. It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.

The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.

![pokemon home vs pokemon go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-home-vs-pokemon-go.jpg)
