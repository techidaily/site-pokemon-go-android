### What is Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield?

Like Shiny Stone, dusk stone, Sun Stone, and Moon Stone, Dawn Stone is another peculiar evolution item in Pokémon Sword and Shield. If you combine Dawn Stone with certain Pokémon, they will evolve to another level. This peculiar stone was introduced in Generation IV, and in terms of appearance, Dawn Stone sparkles like a glittering eye.

You can get dawn stone from the Digging Duo found near the Wild Area nursery. You will, however, be required to pay them 500 watts before digging random items for you. Remember, this is a trial and error thing, and you might have to spend a lot of watts before finding a dawn stone. Also, you can get any evolutionary stone, including the Dawn Stone in the Lake of Outrage. Here, you will have to first obtain a Rotom Bike on route 9 to move across the water.

### Pokémon that Evolve with Dawn Stone

As aforementioned, dawn stone is an evolution item that is used to evolve certain species of Pokémon. To evolve your Pokémon using Dawn Stone in Pokémon Sword and Shield, enter the bag menu and choose the "Other Items" tab. Hover on the Dawn Stone and select the "Use this item" option. Finally, select the Pokémon to evolve. These Pokémon that can be evolved using dawn stone include:

Kirlia is a small humanoid Pokémon whose upper body and arms are white while the waist and legs are light green. This makes it appear as though it is wearing tights. Kirlia's natural abilities include synchronization and trace. It loves dancing on sunny mornings and becomes more beautiful when they sense e positive emotions of trainers. A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.

### 2\. Snorunt

Snorunt is an ice-type Pokémon that was introduced in Generation III. It is also referred to as the "Snow Hat Pokémon." You can find Snorunt in seafoam café, snow canyon, or even in Mysterious Grotto. Furthermore, you can obtain it by trading or Pokémon Roulette. Snorunt can evolve into Glalie or Froslass. If it reaches level 42, Snorunt evolves to Glalie. For Snorunt to evolve into Froslass, it requires a dawn stone. However, the Snorunt must be a female to evolve to Froslass.

It is every player's wish to avoid the long hunt for a Dawn Stone into their Podex. This issue has given birth to some of the hacks and tricks to help players cross territory and find the intended evolution item or Pokémon. Some of these tricks include:

### 1\. Use iOS spoofing tool- Dr. Fone Virtual Location

[Dr. Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) is an amazing iOS spoofer tool that allows users to fake their actual location. This makes it a good tool for location-based games like Pokémon Go. With Dr. Fone Virtual Location, you can teleport to whichever place across the globe by a click of a button. If you want to simulate movements to confuse the game app, you can simulate two or multiple points. Furthermore, you can leverage the joystick to improve the flexibility of GPS control. To teleport to any place in the world with Dr. Fone Virtual Location's help, follow the steps below.

**Step 1.** Download Dr. Fone Virtual Location and install it on your computer. Once installed, launch it and then select the "Virtual Location" tab on the primary window. Also, connect your iOS device to the computer.

Nevertheless, you can try it if you have got some penny to spare.
