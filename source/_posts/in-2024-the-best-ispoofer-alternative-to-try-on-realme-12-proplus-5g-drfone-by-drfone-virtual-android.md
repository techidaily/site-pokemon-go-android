## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Realme 12 Pro+ 5G

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your iPhone location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

You can follow these simple steps to use this iSpoofer alternative to change your iPhone location easily.

**Note:** Keep in mind the cooldown duration before changing your location to ensure your account won’t get banned by Niantic while using the location spoofer. For instance, wait for a few minutes and only change your location realistically.

## Part 3: How to Spoof your Realme 12 Pro+ 5G Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.

![enable developer options](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg)

Great! Now you can go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and turn on the Mock Location option.

![allow mock locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/allow-mock-locations.jpg)

**Step 2: Install a Mock Location App**

Afterward, you can go to the Play Store and install any reliable mock location app from developers like Hola or Lexa. Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device.

![fake gps lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg)

Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.

![select mock location app](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 3: Change your device’s location**

That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Realme 12 Pro+ 5G device’s location.

![fake location on lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-location-on-lexa.jpg)

There you go! After reading this post, I’m sure that you would be able to know about the iSpoofer use for Pokemon Go. Since iSpoofer has been shut down, you can no longer use it to change your iPhone location. Therefore, you can consider [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) (iOS & Android) as an ideal iSpoofer alternative for your device. In just a few clicks, you can change the location of your iPhone anywhere you like and that too without jailbreaking your phone.

## How to Get and Use Pokemon Go Promo Codes On Realme 12 Pro+ 5G

The steady increase in the number of Pokemon Go users has simultaneously led to the expansion of the software. And such is the use of **Pokemon Go promo codes** and Pokemon promo cards. Pokemon Go promo codes are short-time alphanumeric codes that allow you to receive free in-game items, as Pokemon prize cards are awards that are gifted to the players who can intensely beat the Pokemon and knock it out.

Pokemon promo codes or promo cards elevate your game to a whole new level since you will be able to possess the Poke balls, berries, lucky eggs, incense, and other various loots. They will make your game an absolute breeze, and you necessarily won’t move around as you play. Besides, Pokemon promo codes are short-lasting; you, therefore, need to claim them quickly.

This article gives an insight on how to get and use Pokemon Go promo codes and promo cards.

## Part 1: How to Get Pokemon Go Promo Codes

Pokemon Go often offers promo codes on special events or after successful partnerships.

The availability of Pokemon promo codes is not constant – They do come and go.

Pokemon promo codes are unpredictable, and so are their rewards. Some promo codes will offer exceptional gifts such as cosmetics, while others may be in-game supplies such as Pokeballs and berries.

Niantic shares some free Pokemon Go promo codes on their official Twitter account. Their official statement on the website says, "Niantic offers a limited supply of one-time use codes in conjunction with special events or sponsored partnerships."

Pokemon Go also has daily free boxes, the ones you attain at no additional cost.

To check if you have received your daily free boxes, you need to glimpse at your store on a day-to-day basis.

With your free boxes, you can obtain different items.

## Part 2: The Latest Active Pokemon GO Promo Codes (January 2024)

The latest active **Pokemon Go promo codes** are less in number and are not readily available. However, here is the list of functional and usable Pokemon Go promo codes.
