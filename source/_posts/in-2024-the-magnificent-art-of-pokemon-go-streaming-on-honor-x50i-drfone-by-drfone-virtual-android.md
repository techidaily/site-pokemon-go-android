![pokemon go streaming live](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-1.JPG)

We all know that video content online can be monetized through in-feed advertisements and sponsorships. The same thing goes for Pokemon Go streaming. You can earn a specific amount from every ad that appears on your livestream. Don’t worry. It doesn’t take much time and effort to implement. Most of the time, you just need to flash the promotional materials during the broadcast.

### It can help you meet new friends or even famous people in the industry

As we all know, virtual interaction is indeed a powerful spark that ignites connections between people. Don’t worry. That’s totally fine. In fact, you can take advantage of it to improve your follower count and meet famous people.

### It can improve cognitive performance

It’s true to say that multi-tasking is the core of Pokemon Go streaming. Of course, you have to stay focused on the actual game while engaging with your viewers. That seems like a handful of work. But fret not. Juggling multiple tasks one after another is actually beneficial to your health. As you get exposed to such arrangements over and over, your cognitive performance further improves, too.

![global presence](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-2.JPG)

Fate works in mysterious ways. We never know what’s waiting ahead. One day, you’re just an ordinary Pokemon Go player who enjoys catching Pokemon around the neighborhood. The next, you’re a star trainer competing globally for championship events. That’s possible to happen with Pokemon Go streaming as your ultimate stepping stone. Hence, don’t ever underestimate the power of this venture.

## How to Live-Stream Pokemon Go on Mobile Phones

The primary mechanics of Pokemon Go involve a lot of outdoor strolling and physical movement. For instance, you have to walk around the street to catch as many Pokemon as possible. Another thing is that you need to visit the physical location of the PokeStops to spin the Photo Disc. Therefore, it’s highly recommended to use mobile devices when streaming Pokemon Go adventures. Don’t fret. Most modern smartphones nowadays are capable of handling such demanding tasks. Do you want to try it now? Here’s a short guide to help you get started.

### Check your mobile device and internet connection very well

![smartphone and internet power](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-3.JPG)

It’s fair to say that Pokemon Go streaming is not extremely particular when it comes to equipment. You can actually go live under natural daylight and document your adventure as it is. However, keep in mind that you’re simultaneously doing two different tasks in this regard. One is streaming, and the other is playing. Therefore, ensure your mobile device and internet connection can handle heavy workloads as such. A smartphone with 8 GB RAM (or higher) and an internet connection of at least 25 Mbps is highly recommended.

### Choose a live-streaming application and create an account

Pick the best one, and then create your Pokemon Go streaming account. Optimize your profile and make sure that the details are complete.

### Set up the Pokemon Go Livestream

![set up live stream](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-5.JPG)

After that, add some keywords and specify the language of your stream. Yes. It’s very important because it will help interested viewers find you on the internet. Lastly, check the audio output. Adjust the volume clarity if necessary. Once you’re done, it’s time to hit the Go Live button and say “Hi” to the world.

### Start playing Pokemon Go

![play pokemon live](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-livestream-6.JPG)

Play Pokemon Go as if nobody is watching you online. Simply put, carry on with your usual gaming routine. Don’t let the audience distract you from the game. However, make sure that you interact with them as you go along. Try talking while you’re on the ground and catching Pokemon nearby. Respond to the comments once in a while. The point is that you have to extend the actual Pokemon Go experience to them. Trust yourself. You can definitely do that.

## Important Tips When Streaming Pokemon Go Online
