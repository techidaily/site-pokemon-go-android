As the Ultra League Pokemon Go is not as cheap to develop a team as the great league, there is still a chance of being a CP cap of 2500.

However, a slightly higher CP brings more legendaries appearances that you have been catching in Raids or weekly Research for years.

For your help, here are the trios for your better understanding of the building up of a team. Consider following as examples-

- Mew and Giratina are in the majority of triumphing compositions. Suicune is replaceable with Cressida, Alolan Muk, Dragonite, Registeel, Jirachi, or more from Pokemon go ultra league tier list.
- You should prefer having a starter team if there is no legendary pokemon. Unlock with Candy and Stardust— wreak massive damage, building a team of three starters is more than feasible.

## How to Use Pokémon Emerald Master Ball Cheat On Honor Magic 5

One of the main goals of playing Pokémon is getting as many Pokémon as you can, training and evolving them so you can defeat any opposing trainers, and get to the top of the winning charts.

However, these Pokémon characters can be a little difficult to catch, especially in the wild. When you lob a Pokéball at a Pokémon, there are chances that it could escape.

What if there was a way in which you could catch a Pokémon creature every time, even Legendary Pokémon?

The Pokémon emerald master ball can do this with no effort on your part. Simply activate the ball and the Pokémon is captured. This makes the emerald Pokémon master ball a very important asset. In this article, you get to know all the Pokémon master ball cheat codes that you can use to get these valuable assets.

![An image of a Pokémon Master Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/masterball-pokemon.jpg)

_**Tips:** Catch Pokémon like a Pro with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location! Capture as many Pokémon as possible within a short time, no matter where they appear. Explore different locations virtually and become a Pokémon-catching master! Try it now!_

## Part 1: Do you know the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball?

![The best ball to catch Pokémon – Pokémon emerald Master Raid Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-emerald-ball.jpg)

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball is a unique Pokéball that is used to capture Pokémon creatures without fail. It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.

The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.

The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.

## Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.

The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.

**958D8046  
A7151D70

8CEB681A.**

All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.

If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.

You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.

When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:  
**82005274 0001**

You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”. Now set it to “autodetect” and you will be able to get Pokémon Master Emerald Balls at any time you wish.

![Enter PokeMart to but Pokémon Emerald Master Balls](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-4.jpg)

## Part 4: Other tips to level up on Pokémon go

When you need to level up on Pokémon Go, the best and legal way is to get as much XP as possible within the shortest time possible. Now there are very many ways in which you can amass XP but we shall look at some of the best and easiest ways to go about this.

Here are a few of the best ways to go about this:

### Mass Friending

Having a lot of friends is not what gets you XP, but the quality of friends that you have. Here is what you get from having high-quality friends.

- 3,000 XP for a Great Friend
- 50,000 XP for an Ultra Friend
- 100,000 XP for a Best Friend

Timing the way your friendship levels up, and then dropping a Lucky Egg will hugely boost your XP. However, you can only use this process once for every friend per day. This method is great but it would take you 3 months for any friend to become a Best Friend.

### Mass Raids

Raiding Gyms can get you a lot of XP. This is more so when you go for Legendary Raids. You can get up to 10,000 XP for getting into a Legendary Raid. This becomes 20,000 XP if you have a Lucky Egg and 40,000 XP if you use a double XP event together with a Lucky Egg.

**How do you go about this?**

- Add up your stockpile of Premium Raid Passes
- Join a local Raid group through Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, or other social networks that they use.
- Fix up a Raid Train, which is the process of moving from one Raid to another as a group, and this allows you to Raid as much as possible in a short time.

Do as many of these Raids as you can.

### Mass catching and Mass evolving

You can also catch as many Pokémon as you can and then use a Lucky Egg and their Candies to evolve them at the same time. This requires that you evolve many Similar Pokémon and they should be cheap to evolve. You can get a lot of XP in this way.

But how do you catch as many Pokémon as possible within a short time?

This is where teleporting tools such as [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) comes in. This is a wonderful and powerful tool that allows you to teleport from one area to another without the game realizing that you are spoofing your location.

## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Honor Magic 5?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

![iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg)

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account. Here are the simple steps that you need to follow to work with [Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) for spoofing location

## Part 3 - Tips to avoid being Banned

- You need to give enough time for the cool down. This means, as soon as you change your location, wait for a few minutes before you can play the game again so that the ‘vigilante’ does not catch this abrupt change.
- Try not to use apps that are too amateur, having fake reviews on Google/App stores because these will be too vulnerable and detectable.
- If you are not sure where to spoof, then there are certain safe co-ordinates that lon term gamers of Pokemon Go suggest so you can opt for them. They are just for starters until you find your way through
- Try not to make abrupt location changes - keep it nearby initially and slowly try to increase your radius. An abrupt change can draw attention.
