## The Ultimate Guide to Get the Rare Candy on Pokemon Go Fire Red On Nubia Z50S Pro

In all Pokemon Go versions, a Rare Candy will automatically uplift you to the next level. These cadies are powerful and come with a lot of extra rewards. That said they are also very difficult to find, especially in Pokemon Fire Red. This article will show you some of the ways in which you can find Rare Cady, and level up quickly to improve your status in the game.

## Part 1: What is the rare candy in Pokémon Go Fire Red?

All Pokemon Go game variations have Rare Candy, and they are mainly used to upgrade the level of any Pokemon by 1. If you were at level 9, you automatically go up to level 10, etc. This will save you from having to engage in battles to raise your level. You may also earn the level attacks that you would have earned at that level, even without having to fight.

There are a limited number of Rare Candy in Pokemon Go Fire Red. However, you can get unlimited Rare Candies by using Pokemon Go Fire Red Rare Candy cheat codes through GameShark or Action Replay. You may also get them through cloning your existing Rare Cady.

When you use a Rare Candy, you get enough Exp. Points to move to the next level. This means that it is best to use them for getting to the next level, especially when it becomes too challenging. Although you get to the next level, you will not earn any Effort Value Points, which will make your Pokemon weaker than it would have been if you had leveled up through training.

## How to Use Pokémon Emerald Master Ball Cheat On Nubia Z50S Pro

One of the main goals of playing Pokémon is getting as many Pokémon as you can, training and evolving them so you can defeat any opposing trainers, and get to the top of the winning charts.

However, these Pokémon characters can be a little difficult to catch, especially in the wild. When you lob a Pokéball at a Pokémon, there are chances that it could escape.

What if there was a way in which you could catch a Pokémon creature every time, even Legendary Pokémon?

The Pokémon emerald master ball can do this with no effort on your part. Simply activate the ball and the Pokémon is captured. This makes the emerald Pokémon master ball a very important asset. In this article, you get to know all the Pokémon master ball cheat codes that you can use to get these valuable assets.

![An image of a Pokémon Master Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/masterball-pokemon.jpg)

_**Tips:** Catch Pokémon like a Pro with Dr.Fone - Virtual Location! Capture as many Pokémon as possible within a short time, no matter where they appear. Explore different locations virtually and become a Pokémon-catching master! Try it now!_

## Part 1: Do you know the Pokémon Emerald Master Ball?

![The best ball to catch Pokémon – Pokémon emerald Master Raid Ball](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-emerald-ball.jpg)

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball is a unique Pokéball that is used to capture Pokémon creatures without fail. It is found in Generation I and is always used in the wild.

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball has a spherical shape juts like the regular Pokéballs that you are used to. It has two halves, with the top one being purple in color and having a black band along the center. The top half has the letter “M” written on it, which possibly means “Master”.

The Pokémon master ball emerald will capture all Pokémon in the wild apart from the ghost Marowak when it is in the Pokémon Tower. When you use the ball, you bypass the Pokéball throwing process and animation, and you simply move on to the scene where the Pokémon has been captured. Even when Legendary Pokémon tries to swat the master ball away, they miss and they are captured in an instant.

The one downside about the Pokémon ball emerald is that it cannot be used where you can easily use a normal Pokéball. For example, when you are in a wild battle that has two or more opposing trainers, you will lose the Pokémon emerald master ball if you use it; the opposing trainers can swat the ball away in this case, and you waste a valuable asset.

## Part 2: Does the master ball cheat code still work?

The Pokémon Emerald Master Ball cheat GameShark code still works and you can get your Emerald Master Ball with ease.

The list of GameShark Pokémon Master Ball cheat codes below has been tested and still works very well.

**958D8046  
A7151D70  
8BB602F7  
8CEB681A.**

All you have to do is activate the code, go to the PokéMart, and then get a Master Ball for free.

If you are using Pokémon Emerald version 1.1, you may not be able to use the cheats; they work best on version 1.0.

You should also disable the cheat codes so they do not conflict with other codes in the future.

When you are using My Boy, you can use the following code:  
**82005274 0001**

You should then set the “cheat type” to “codebreaker”. Now set it to “autodetect” and you will be able to get Pokémon Master Emerald Balls at any time you wish.

## Part 3: How do you get unlimited master balls in Pokémon Emerald?

There are ways in which you can get unlimited Pokémon Master Balls using the Pokémon emerald Master Ball cheat codes available today.

**Step 1 -** Save your game

![Enter PokeMart to but Pokémon Emerald Master Balls](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/virtual-location/pokemon-master-ball-cheat-code-4.jpg)

Only one Master Ball can be bought at a time, but you can do this as many times as you want. If you are already inside the PokeMart when you enter the code, you may have to walk out and walk back in again for it to work.

## Part 4: Other tips to level up on Pokémon go

When you need to level up on Pokémon Go, the best and legal way is to get as much XP as possible within the shortest time possible. Now there are very many ways in which you can amass XP but we shall look at some of the best and easiest ways to go about this.

Here are a few of the best ways to go about this:

### Mass Friending

Having a lot of friends is not what gets you XP, but the quality of friends that you have. Here is what you get from having high-quality friends.

- 3,000 XP for a Great Friend
- 50,000 XP for an Ultra Friend
- 100,000 XP for a Best Friend

Timing the way your friendship levels up, and then dropping a Lucky Egg will hugely boost your XP. However, you can only use this process once for every friend per day. This method is great but it would take you 3 months for any friend to become a Best Friend.

### Mass Raids

Raiding Gyms can get you a lot of XP. This is more so when you go for Legendary Raids. You can get up to 10,000 XP for getting into a Legendary Raid. This becomes 20,000 XP if you have a Lucky Egg and 40,000 XP if you use a double XP event together with a Lucky Egg.

**How do you go about this?**

- Add up your stockpile of Premium Raid Passes
- Join a local Raid group through Facebook, WhatsApp, Discord, or other social networks that they use.
- Fix up a Raid Train, which is the process of moving from one Raid to another as a group, and this allows you to Raid as much as possible in a short time.

Do as many of these Raids as you can.

### Mass catching and Mass evolving

You can also catch as many Pokémon as you can and then use a Lucky Egg and their Candies to evolve them at the same time. This requires that you evolve many Similar Pokémon and they should be cheap to evolve. You can get a lot of XP in this way.

But how do you catch as many Pokémon as possible within a short time?

This is where teleporting tools such as [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) comes in. This is a wonderful and powerful tool that allows you to teleport from one area to another without the game realizing that you are spoofing your location.

## Ultimate Guide to Catch the Regional-Located Pokemon For Nubia Z50S Pro

![complete your pokedex with regional pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/catch-all-pokemon-go-regional-exclusives-1.jpg)

Since its release in 2016, Pokemon GO, Niantic’s viral augmented reality mobile game, has slowly but surely been adding regional Pokemon, exclusive creatures living in specific areas around the globe.

While keeping track of where each regional Pokemon spawns can be pretty confusing, catching these Pokemon poses another challenge. Completing your Pokedex requires a lot of traveling to specific parts of the globe, trading with players who have been there, or waiting for Pokemon GO’s special events.

Alternatively, players can use virtual location-changing tools like Wondershare Dr.Fone, and today, we’ll show you how to catch all **Pokemon GO regional exclusives** with this easy-to-use app.

## Part 1. What Are Regional Pokemon?

Regional Pokemon are exclusive creatures in Niantic’s Pokemon GO AR game that only live in specific regions across the globe. The area in which a particular Pokemon can be found depends on the nature of that Pokemon. For example, Tropius can only be found in tropical parts of the continent.

## Part 2. How Regional Pokemon in Pokemon GO Work

Catching all Pokemon GO regional exclusive creatures and completing your Pokedex is a great challenge. There are multiple ways you can go about it, including some of the following strategies:

- Traveling to specific parts of the world;
- Using Wondershare Dr.Fone’s Virtual Location Changer;
- Waiting for special events that lift distribution restrictions;
- Trading Pokemon with other players from across the globe.

Avid Pokemon trainers can use one or a combination of these strategies to swiftly fill up their Pokedex with complete data about all Pokemon in the wild.

## Part 3. Continents of Regional Pokemon

![regional spawn points in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/catch-all-pokemon-go-regional-exclusives-2.jpg)

The spawn points of regional Pokemon vary significantly between creatures. Some are exclusive to a hemisphere, others to a continent, while the third group only spawns in a few specific countries. Keeping track of it all can be challenging, and that’s why we’ve created a detailed information table with regions and specific Pokemon GO regional exclusives you can find in each.

| **Region** | **Pokemon** |
| --- | --- |
| _Africa_ | Corsola, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Pansear, Throh, Basculin, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Red Flabebe, Furfrou Trim, Oricorio, Kartana, Celesteela |
| _Asia_ | Farfetch’d, Corsola, Volbeat, Torkoal, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pachirisu, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Fabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana Celesteela |
| _Australia_ | Kangaskhan, Corsola, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Chatot, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmor, Vivillon, Celesteela |
| _Europe_ | Mr. Mime, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Solrock, Tropius, Shellos, Mime Jr., Pansear, Sawk, Basculin, Sigilyph, Heatmor, Vivillon, Klefki, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana |
| _Middle East_ | Corsola, Tropius, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansear, Basculin, Sawk, Sigilyph, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Kartana |
| _New Zealand_ | Chatot, Relicanth, Shellos, Volbeat, Zangoose, Lunatone, Shellos, Pansage, Sawk, Basculin, Heatmore, Vivillon, Celesteela |

| _South America_ | Heracross, Corsola, Illumise, Seviper, Solrock, Shellos, Chatot, Panpour, Throh, Basculin, Maractus, Durant, Vivillon, Flabebe, Furfrou, Oricorio, Celesteela |

While they’re categorized as available on the entire continent, it’s worth noting that some Pokemon can only be found in particular regions like France or Russia. To learn more about each, you’ll need to find information about their regional distribution.

## Part 4. Learning About the Regional Pokemon Distribution

With almost 60 Pokemon GO regional exclusives in 2024, keeping track of where each creature spawns can be a nightmare, especially when some Pokemon can only be found in tiny and specific areas. However, you don’t necessarily have to remember the location of each regional Pokemon, as there are other ways of learning about their distribution.

### Getting Information From the Community

The primary method of acquiring information that most players rely on is keeping in touch with the Pokemon GO community. Players can follow Pokemon GO creators, watch YouTube news channels covering new releases, and join countless forums and social media pages dedicated to the game.

### Using Official Pokemon Go Announcements

Official announcements are another way to learn more about Pokemon GO’s regional exclusives. Keeping track of these will help you track regional spawn points and special events. Enabling notifications from the game on your mobile device can also be particularly helpful in keeping track of announcements.

## Part 5. How to Quickly Travel to Different Regions

While regional Pokemon GO exclusives have brought novelties to Niantic’s viral AR game, they require a lot of traveling and trading, making it significantly more challenging for players to catch them all, which is the whole point of the game.

However, there’s also an alternative to traveling and trading, as countless virtual location-changing apps can help avid Pokemon GO players catch these exclusive beasts. Wondershare Dr.Fone is a fantastic example of such a tool, and with a quick setup and a few clicks, it can help players move without moving.

Using Dr.Fone to change your virtual location is remarkably straightforward and can be done in a few steps. Here’s how:

Movement simulation works exceptionally well for catching Pokemon around the globe, and you’ll be able to encounter dozens of these. Use Wondershare Dr.Fone to progress swiftly through the game and catch them all!

## Part 6. Pokemon GO Regional Spawns and Events

While incredibly straightforward and helpful, changing your virtual location isn’t the only way you can go about catching Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures.

The game’s special events often remove regional Pokemon distribution restrictions, allowing exclusive creatures to spawn around the globe for a particular period. With these, you can find and catch Asia-specific Pokemon in North America and vice versa.

It’s worth noting that these special events are pretty rare in Pokemon GO. You’ll need to pay close attention to the game’s announcements, as you don’t want to miss an opportunity to add another, hard-to-find, regional Pokemon to your Pokedex.

## Part 7. Trading Regional Pokemon

As mentioned above, trading regional Pokemon GO exclusives is another one of your options if you can’t or don’t want to travel. Players can find other users from around the globe and initiate Pokemon GO creature exchanges to complete their Pokedex with all the available regionals.

However, trading regional Pokemon can also be quite challenging as it requires finding users willing to swap their region-specific Pokemon for the ones you have. There’ll undoubtedly be situations where users might not want to give up a more valuable catch for the one in your region, making trading a less viable option than changing your virtual location.

## Conclusion

Completing your Pokedex and becoming the ultimate Pokemon trainer in Niantic’s viral AR game can be particularly challenging due to Pokemon GO’s regional exclusive creatures. To catch these, players must travel to regions where these Pokemon spawn, trade with other users who’ve visited these areas, or wait for the game’s special events to lift regional spawn restrictions.

Alternatively, Pokemon trainers can use GPS-spoofing apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone and its Virtual Location Changer feature to change their mobile device’s GPS location. This helpful feature lets players move without moving and travel to specific regional spawn points without physically going there.
