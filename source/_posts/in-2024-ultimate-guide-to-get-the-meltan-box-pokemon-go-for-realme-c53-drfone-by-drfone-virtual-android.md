## Part 1: What is the meltan box and how does it work?

Meltan, the mythical Pokemon is also described as a Hex Nut Pokemon. A major part of its body is built from liquid metal and its shape is fluid. It generates electricity using the metal that it absorbs from the outside sources. The pokemon uses its arms and legs to corrode metal and absorb it into its own body.

![meltan pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/meltan-pokemon.jpg)

The meltan box is actually a mystery box that you cannot receive through the traditional method. It requires you to make an unconventional move to get this box and catch this different pokemon. The process involved to get the meltan box pokemon go include the following:

1. The first and foremost thing you need to do is deport a Pokemon from Pokemon Go to Pokemon Let’s Go. You don’t have to transfer it to your own copy of Let’s Go. A friend’s copy would come in great help here.
2. For making the transfer, you will get a mystery box in Pokemon Go. This box will allow the meltan to run into the wild for about 30 minutes. It gives you the chance to latch the pokemon.
3. If you cannot catch meltan in 30 minutes, you will have to wait and repeat the above process again. As the mystery box will close after 30 minutes, and meltan will vanish from the wild.

### How to find rare Pokémon or complete your Pokédex?

There are various options you can try to find rare Pokémon and complete your Pokedex.

- **Increase your trainer level.** The higher your trainer level is, the higher your chances of finding a rare Pokémon are. So, up your XP game by using lucky eggs, completing research quests, and catching more Pokémon.
- **Trade with other players.** If you have friends who also play Pokémon Go, you can trade rare and even legendary Pokémon with them. Just make sure you’re in a specific range with them.
- **Use incense and lures.** Both of these will help you attract more Pokémon. As for Lures, once they are used on a PokeStop, any player can enjoy its effects as a bonus.
- **Play on the Community Days.** If you’re looking to catch a Shiny Pokémon, don’t forget to play on community days. It is important because Shinies have a much higher rate of appearing during these days!
- **Have friends in other regions.** You cannot complete your Pokedex without getting region-exclusive Pokémon! Having friends from other regions ensures you can trade regional Pokémon with each other.
- **Use a virtual GPS at home.** If you don’t have anyone to trade your regional Pokémon with, you can use a virtual location. It can be achieved by using a specialized app, like Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for this purpose to access rare locations and get more Pokémon!

Considering time and money, the first few of the above methods are not so easy to realize in practice. So here, we are exclusively introducing one of the most efficient and low-cost ways - virtual GPS to catch, power up, and evolve your Pokémon. Are you ready to complete your Pokedex faster?

### What is Dr.Fone – Virtual Location

Dr.Fone Virtual Location is a super useful software when it comes to spoofing the locations of your device. You can use this app to not only change the GPS for Pokémon Go but also simulate the GPS movement with a joystick! On top of that, the software is super easy to use, so you don’t need to be tech-savvy to use it. With Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, you can easily access region-exclusive Pokémon. Whether you want to catch Klefki, which is exclusive to France, or the Hawai’i-exclusive Comfey, Dr.Fone makes it all possible.
