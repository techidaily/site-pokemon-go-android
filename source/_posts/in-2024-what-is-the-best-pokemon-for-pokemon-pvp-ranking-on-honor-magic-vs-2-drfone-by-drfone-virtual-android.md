## Part 3. Best Ways to Get Stardust in Pokemon Go

Since having Stardust is crucial for your Pokemon Go experience, you may be looking for the best ways to accumulate as many consumables as possible. We’ll present a couple of ways to reach your goals below.

### Through Pvp Rewards

One of the best ways to earn Stardust is through Player versus Player features. When you’re playing with other users, you can earn Stardust based on the number of your previous wins, your game level, and the PVP outcome.

For instance, if you’re a Rank 2, you can earn around 2,000 Stardust points by winning a battle, and if you’re Rank 24, the number increases to about 200,000. You can also use a Star Piece to multiply your winnings by 1.5.

Another method is to play with your friends, and the Stardust points can vary from 300 to 1000, depending on your opponent’s rank.

![pvp in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-3.jpg)

### By Opening Gifts

The maximum Stardust you can get in one gift is 300, which may not seem like a lot. However, if you open your gifts regularly, you’ll have the desired Stardust amount in no time. You should also combine this method with others mentioned in this article for the best experience.

![opening gifts in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-4.jpg)

### By Hatching Pokemon

You can check out the list below to determine how much Stardust you’ll collect through your egg hatching:

- 1600–3200 Stardust for hatching a 10km egg;

![eggs in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-5.jpg)

### By Catching Pokemon

Catching Pokemon is one of the most efficient ways of earning Stardust points. Each Pokemon has a base rate of 100 Stardust points, but you can earn more points depending on the Pokemon’s evolution stage. For instance, if the Pokemon is in the second stage, you’ll earn an additional 500 Stardust points.

Another thing you should look out for is specific Pokemon characters – some may carry more than 100 Stardust points as their base. For instance, you can get a whopping 2,100 Stardust points if you catch Audino, 950 for Garbodor, 1,000 for Chimecho, etc.

If you stay consistent and catch at least one Pokemon daily, you can get up to 9,000 Stardust points on the seventh day. Moreover, the first catch of the day will bring you an additional 1,800 points.

![catch a pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-6.jpg)

### By Claiming Raid Rewards

When the Boss enters your Gym, you may think it’s a stressful scenario. However, you should consider the bright side and fight to earn valuable rewards, such as Stardust points.

Once you and your team defeat the Boss, you can collect the prizes. You’ll win 1,000 Stardust points each time a Boss enters, even if it leaves the Gym without a fight.

If you defeat the boss, you’ll also get a chance to catch the Pokemon, which can bring you even more Stardust points!

![a raid battle in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-7.jpg)

### By Getting Rocket Rewards

Additionally, if you ever face Giovanni, you’ll get 5,000 points for fighting and beating him.

![rocket battle in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-8.jpg)

### By Earning Research Rewards Through Completed Tasks

The amount of points you will win depends on the task's difficulty and duration. However, you should complete all the daily tasks to accumulate as many consumables as possible.

![pokemon go research tasks](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/importance-of-stardust-in-pokemon-go-9.jpg)
