## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.

### Fix 2: Grant Location access to Pokemon Go

If you have not granted the location services permission to Pokemon Go, then you can get the no GPS signal error on it. To fix the Pokemon Go GPS issues, you can go to its Settings > Location > App-based Permissions and enable the GPS access for Pokemon Go.

### Fix 3: Reinstall the Pokemon Go App

As listed above, one of the reasons for this Pokemon Go GPS bug could be a corrupt or outdated app. The easiest way to fix this is by uninstalling Pokemon Go on your phone. Afterward, restart your phone and go to Play Store to install Pokemon Go on your Realme 11X 5G again.

### Fix 4: Set GPS on High Accuracy

If the Pokemon Go GPS is not accurate on your device, then you need to change its accuracy index on your phone. You can just go to your phone’s Settings > Location > Location Mode and set it to “High Accuracy” so that Pokemon Go can accurately display your present location.
