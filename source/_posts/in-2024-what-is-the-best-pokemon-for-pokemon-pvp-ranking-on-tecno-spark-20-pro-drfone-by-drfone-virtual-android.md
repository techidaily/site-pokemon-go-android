- **Step 1.** **Activate Teleport Mode in Dr.Fone - Virtual Location**

Open Wondershare Dr.Fone - Virtual Location, connect your smartphone with an original USB cable, and choose the "Teleport Mode" option located in the top-right section. The specific icon for Teleport Mode is the first one from the left in that section. Once Teleport Mode is activated, click on the search bar at the top-left to input the desired location. After entering the location, press "Enter" to continue.

- **Step 2.** **Teleport to the Chosen Location**

As you enter the desired location, the map will confirm your selection. If you wish to teleport to this designated location, click on "Move Here." The smartphone's location will promptly switch to the chosen destination and reflect on the map. You can then verify that the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device's current location matches the updated location by opening the maps app on the Tecno Spark 20 Pro device.

- **Step 3.** **Simulate Movement with One-Stop Route**

To simulate movement, navigate to the top-right section and click “One-Stop Route.” It is the third icon from the left. After moving to the desired location, tap anywhere on the map to designate your destination. Specify the number of round trips and opt for either a Round or Loop trip. Adjust the walking speed by sliding the speed option. Finally, tap "Move Here" for the movement simulation.

- **Step 4.** **Enable the Multi-Stop Route Feature**

If you want to visit more than one stop, enable the Multi-Stop Route mode. You can do it by accessing the top-right section adjacent to the One-Stop Route mode. Once activated, designate multiple locations on the map by selecting your desired points. Specify the number of trips and speed settings. Initiate the process by clicking on "Start Moving." During the simulation, you can "Pause" the sequence at any point.
