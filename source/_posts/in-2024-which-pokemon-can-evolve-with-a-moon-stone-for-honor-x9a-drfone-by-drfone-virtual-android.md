You can walk the required distance for egg hatching or explore Routes from the comfort of your own home. However, there have been reports recently about Pokemon Go DeFit not working. Is there a substitute for this software? The short answer is absolutely yes. Wondershare Dr.Fone has a powerful Virtual Location feature that works exactly like DeFit. It can also simulate GPD movement to complete Pokemon Go Routes without going outdoors. Do you want to try it? Here’s a short guide for you.



- **Step 1:** Download Wondershare Dr.Fone from its [<u>official website.</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) Right after, install it on your computer.
- **Step 2:** Open the newly installed software on your desktop. Once it fully loads up, connect your smartphone immediately using a data cable. Follow the on-screen instructions to establish a secure connection between the computer and your device.
- **Step 3:** Access the left-side panel and then click **Toolbox.** Navigate to the main dashboard afterward and then click **Virtual Location.** If it’s your first time using this feature, let Wondershare Dr.Fone download the additional resources needed.
- **Step 4:** After the successful download, the Virtual Location feature will then appear in a separate window. Head over to the menu bar at the top-right corner of your screen and then click **One-Stop Route.** The starting point for the simulation will be designated based on your current location. If you wish to change it, go back to the menu bar again and then click **Teleport Mode** to assign your preferred starting point. As for the destination, you can search for your desired location or tap anywhere around the map.

- **Step 5:** Calibrate the necessary settings according to your liking. Start by choosing your preferred type and number of trips. Right after, adjust the movement speed by moving the slider from left to write. Then, click **Move Here** to commence the simulation. If you wish to reset your inputs, click **Clear** instead.
