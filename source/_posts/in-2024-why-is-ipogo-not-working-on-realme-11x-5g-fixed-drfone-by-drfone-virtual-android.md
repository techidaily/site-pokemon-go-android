## Why is iPogo not working On Realme 11X 5G? Fixed

The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.

### Why Users download iPogo?

iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;

- The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.
- With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.
- If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.
- You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.
- If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.
- You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.

With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.


## Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working

Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Realme 11X 5G device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.

Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.

Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;

- One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.
- Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.
- Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.

### Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue

It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.

- **Limiting the usage of System Resources:** Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.
- **Too many Items opened:** Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.
- **Keep you Device Clean:** Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.
- **Install the Official Version:** It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.

**Method 1:** Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.

**Method 2:** If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.

**Method 3:** The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.

**Note:** All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.

## Why does the pokemon go battle league not available On Realme 11X 5G

After the incredible hype of finally getting the chance to battle other players, trainers hit a wall marked – Pokémon Go battle leagues Not Available.

It’s not the first time trainers have experienced bugs in the game and a long wait during maintenance breaks, but patience wears thin as after 2 weeks into the release of the super hyped Battle League, trainers all around the world are yet to have access to it.

The root cause of this disappointing course of events was a major bug in the first season of the Battle League. Some players could simply use “charged moves” repetitively without recharging. Thankfully Niantic is coming up with a fix.

## Part 1: What are the Go battle league known issues?

Pokémon Go as a game, is constantly evolving to improve the trainer’s experience which involves finding issues and resolving them. Like all other games, the publisher always tries their best to make the user experience more enriching and fair for the users.

Season 1 of the Battle League’s had a severe bug that a handful of players exploited to rise to the leader board. After a player has lodged few fast moves, (number of fast moves required for each Pokémon to charge attack, varies) the trainer’s Pokémon can lodge a secondary yet stronger charged attack to deal more damage.

The bug in the series implied that a Pokémon – “Melmetal” is able to recharge their charge attack even while attacking with a “Charged” move, essentially making the trainer using the Pokémon invincible during a real battle.

Several trainers immediately tweeted this excruciating bug to Niantic requesting this issue to be resolved immediately, as a result Niantic had to freeze the leader board for that season.

Players when entering the Battle League are shown – Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available Right Now, and all matches that were in progress were not concluded.

![pokemon 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-1.jpg)

Thankfully, the issue has been resolved and trainers can get back into the league without any change in the previous features.

Here’s a set of few known issues in the game currently being investigated by Niantic, which we can hope to see resolved later on in the future;

- **Inconsistent Fast Attacks against Opponent Charged Attacks –** Your fast attacks don’t land a direct hit when the opponent is throwing his Charged Attack.
- **Fast Attacks are slower on Android –** Most android users are experiencing slower fast attacks than iOS users. Niantic has addressed the issue and are awaiting more reports on the issue.
- **Charged Attack Button doesn’t work when tapped -** Occasionally after few uses, the Charged Attack button fails to respond when tapped resulting in slower attacks during matches.
- **Go Battle wins are not counted –** Some times, a Go battle win is not counted in the Go Battle League Set and remains unrecorded in the journal.
- **Animation Glitch of the trainer throwing a Poke ball –** A glitch occurs occasionally when the trainer avatar is seen throwing a Poke Ball repetitively.
- **Disappearance of the Charged Attack and Switch Button –** The button of the Charge Attack and the Switch Pokémon button would eventually disappear in-enabling the trainer to take any action during live battle.
- **Next Battle tab not showing up on the Post-win Screen –** After ending a match or winning a battle, the button for the ‘Next Battle’ option disappears from the Post-win screen.

## Part 2: Why does the go battle not available?

It’s not new for an augmented reality game to have bugs that impede on the fun aspect of the game, but the recent development to Pokémon Go included an update trainers have been waiting for since its release in 2016.

Battle League is a brand new additional feature to the game that allows players to play PVP or one on one matches with other trainers. Ninantic introduced Battle tournaments to be played in three leagues – Great, Ultra and Master, that gives trainers the opportunity to compete and gain dominance over score board.

Pokémon Go is now exploring its roots with Pvp being a part of the original game franchise. We can hope to see the game evolve into a platform for global players to go head to head with each other.

The first season of Pokémon Go Battle League had to be temporarily frozen due to prevalence of broken code (a.k.a. – bug) that created a loophole allowing certain players and unfair advantage.

After attacking your opponent with a Charge move, the move set requires a brief time to recharge in order for the player to be able to use it again.

Few players with the assist of Melmetal (ground and steel type) could lodge constant fast attacks while also using Charge moves with no recharge time. This landed a handful these players to skyrocket to the leader board.

![pokemon 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-2.jpg)

After this issue was tweeted to the notice of the game publisher, Ninattic temporarily paused Battle League. Trainers while accessing the live tournament event would be notified with – “Pokemon Go Battle League Not Available” by the game.

Although this doesn’t mean that trainers wouldn’t be able to play practice matches or close proximity matches. Battle League presents itself as an event in the game which gives trainers the chance to earn bonuses and stardust.

Even so, Pokémon Go continues to resolve issues as they come along and this shows us how there is so much more to look forward to. Battle Leagues, since its debut has had 4 seasons till now and trainers are all pumped for Season 5.

Here’s a list of exciting updates that will be included in the upcoming season;

- At Rank 7 you will encounter a Legendary Pokémon on the Go Battle League battle tracks as similar to the Legendary Pokémon encountered in 5star raids.
- To reach Rank 2 a trainer will need to complete a number of Battles in order to progress.
- From Rank 3 all the way to Rank 10, a higher number of battles must be won to proceed.
- Season 5 will be completed once you reach rank 7 which will earn you the Elite Charged TM rather than an Elite Fast TM.
- In Season 5 few Pokémon’s will get new updated move sets which the trainers can use to train and prepare for upcoming tournaments.

## Part 3: Tips you want to level up your pokemon go?

The basics you need to learn to play Pokémon go is catching Pokémon and powering them up. Other than that there are ways you can speed power up your Pokémon to increase CP to higher levels. The overall Pokémon’s collected, evolved or powered up, and battles fought in Battle League will win you points to level up in Pokémon Go.

Although it might seem like a long and hard journey, it doesn’t need to. You can catch and power up Pokémon faster and cover longer distances with some help from WondershareDr.Fone. With smoother and easier GPS spoofing you can cover Poke stops much quicker.

Here’s some tips you can put to easy use in Levelling Up in Pokémon Go:

## Where Is the Best Place to Catch Dratini On Realme 11X 5G

Dratini is a rare Pokemon that can be found in the wild. It is a Dragon-type Pokemon that evolves into Dragonair and then into Dragonite. Dratini is a popular Pokemon among players due to its rarity and powerful evolution. If you are looking to catch Dratini on your Realme 11X 5G, you may be wondering where the best place to find them is.

Dratini is one of the Pokémon creatures that resemble a snake. It has an elongated blue body with a blue white underside. It carries three-pronged fins on each side of its head which are white in color. Dratini also has a white bump on the forehead.

Dratini has an energy level that is constantly increasing, which makes it grow and can reach a length of more than 6 feet. It sheds its skin every time it has to grow, and usually hide behind a waterfall when shedding. The colony of Dratini lives underwater, living at the bottom feeding on food that falls from the upper levels. Outrage is the signature move for this Pokémon creature.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 1: What’s the evolution of Dratini?

Dratini undergoes two different evolutions

The first un-evolved version is the serpentine Dratini that looks like a snake and continues shedding its skin as it grows. When you get to level 30, Dratini evolves into Dragonair, and at level 55 it becomes Dragonite

### Dragonair

This is an evolution of Dratini, which has a long scaly serpent-like body. It still retails the blue body with a white underside. The white bump on the forehead now becomes a white horn. The budding wings on the side of the head have now grown into full wings. It also carries three crystal orbs, with one on the neck and the other two on the tail.

Dragonair has the ability to stretch its wings so it can fly. It has a huge amount of energy in the body and can discharge the energy through the crystals. The energy that it releases has the ability to change the weather wherever it is. Dragonair can be found in seas and lakes.

### Dragonite

This is a Pokémon character that truly resembles a dragon and is the second evolution of Dratini. It has a yellow thick body, and a couple of antennae that come out of its forehead. It has a striated underbelly. The body is quite large when compared to the small wings.

Dragonite can fly at very high speeds despite its bulky appearance. It is a kindhearted Pokémon, which is as intelligent as a human being. It has been found to have tendencies to save humans from disasters, such as saving those who have come from a capsized ship on the high seas. It lives near the sea and is extremely rare in the Pokémon world.

## Part 2: Where can I find the Dratini nest?

Dratini is a Pokémon that lives in the water. Since it loves lakes and seas, you can find it when you visit areas that are near water. For example, in the United States, the most famous nests for Dratini are found in North Eastern San Francisco, Pier 39 and Pier 15. You will always find Dratini at these sites and they are famous for people who want to farm Dratini.

You may also g West to Squirtle Nest where you can get a lot of Dratini.

Dratini has a 5% spawning chance every day, so if you have the time, you can spend it on these sites as you enjoy the watery view and wait for it to appear.

Dratini nests can also be found in other parts of the world, such as Tokyo, Japan; Sydney and New South Wales, Australia; Paris, France and others.

## Part 3: Are the Dratini nest and spawn spot in the same place?

This is quite a common question for those who are new to the Pokémon universe. Basically, Dratini nests and spawn points are the same for a period of two weeks. The nests then migrate leaving the spawn points to spawn different types of Pokémon.

If the Dratini nest migrates, it can still come back in the future. You should always keep an eye at the spawn point where you first encountered your first Dratini Nest; it may come back once more and you can continue farming Dratini.

Dratini nests will migrate on alternate Thursdays at midnight. The nest migrations are random, so make sure that you visit and hit them many times over the two weeks in order to get the most Dratini that you can.

## Part 4: How to increase the possibility of earning Pokémon Go Dratini?

As mentioned earlier, Dratini can be found in certain places around the world. If you live outside these regions, you cannot be able to get Dratini. The best way to go about getting Dratini in such cases is to virtually relocate your device. This means that you can take your device to Tokyo nest sites even if you live in Africa.

The best app to use for teleportation is [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/)

**Features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)**

- Use the joystick feature to move around the map until you come across Dratini.
- The app allows you to seem to be walking, riding a bike, or in a vehicle, on the map. This simulates real-time travel data, which is important when playing Pokémon Go.
- Any app that relies on geo-location data can safely use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location for teleportation.

**A step-by-step guide to spoof your location using Dr.Fone Virtual Location (iOS)**
