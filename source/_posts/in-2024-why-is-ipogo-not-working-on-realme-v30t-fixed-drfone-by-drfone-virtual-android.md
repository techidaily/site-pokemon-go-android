## Why is iPogo not working On Realme V30T? Fixed

The popular iPogo app is one of the best free apps you can use to spoof on your device while playing Pokémon Go. It is equipped with an abundance of features that allows players to get way ahead in the game by spotting spawns early, catching gym raids, discovering nests and quest events, and so on. If you spot a Pokémon which is way too far from your location, you can use iPogo to fake your virtual coordinates and trick Pokémon Go to think you are nearby that area. Sounds like an amazing app to use right? But, there is a downside to it too as users of the app have repeatedly reported of iPogo not working. The app seems to overload and malfunction after a few hours of repeated usage. This issue is preventing users from harnessing the full potential of their gaming experience.

### Why Users download iPogo?

iPogo is a free to use Pokémon Go++ mod which can be downloaded as an APK file for your iOS devices. It features tools that can be used by players to play the game virtually anywhere in the world while also enhancing the gameplay experience. Few of these exclusive features have been mentioned in the list below;

- The Spin and Auto-cash feature can be used to capture Pokémon and throw a spinning ball without requiring a physical device.
- With just one click you can manage your collection of stored items. It removes the cumbersome ordeal of the game to manually select and delete items when you can erase all un-required items with just one tap.
- If you are on the hunt for special shiny Pokémon, you can do so without having to go through dozens of non-shiny one’s. On activating the Auto-Runaway feature on your iPogo, you can skip through the time consuming animations of all non-shiny Pokémon.
- You can augment the game to let your avatar walk continuously at a desired pace. The speed of your avatar’s movement can be adjusted using iPogo.
- If there are unnecessary elements crowding up your screen, you can hide them temporarily.
- You keep track of Pokémon spawns, quests and raids using the feed on your iPogo.

With all these amazing benefits at hand, it seems almost unfair to not be able to make the best of it if iPogo keeps crashing or stops working. Let’s look into the probable reasons why your iPogo is not working and explore methods to solve this dilemma.


## Part 1: Common problem that iPogo is not working

Pokémon Go players have made several reports of how iPogo is not functioning normally on their devices. For instance, while using the Plus mod on Pokémon Go, the Realme V30T device screen goes completely black and unresponsive making the game inaccessible. Also, devices that run Pokémon Go with iPogo seems to be running slower than those which do not use any helper or spoofing support.

Even if your device is able to withstand the load of using iPogo, it may still be possible to face other app related performance issues like ipogo enhanced-throw not working, ipogo joystick not working and ipogo feeds not working either. All these symptoms sums up the fact that the iPogo app is faltering on your device.

Read on to understand the reasons why your device is unable to run the iPogo mod smoothly;

- One of the root causes which explains why iPogo is crashing could be because you are utilizing too much of your phone’s system resource capacity. This means you have too many tabs or other applications opened on your device that is making the resource distribution falter leading to an automatic shutdown.
- Another plausible reason could be that your iPogo application has not been properly installed. It is widely agreed upon that iPogo is a difficult app to install as it involves going through complex steps making it easier for mistakes to be made, eventually leading to a complete breakdown of the software.
- Since installing iPogo is a cumbersome process, players would often resort to using downloading hacks to get the job done faster. However, not all such hacks can be relied upon as they may end up jail breaking your device or make your version of the app even more unstable.

### Some Easy Solutions for fixing the “iPogo not working” issue

It is often said that short cuts can cut you short or in this case, hacked! Disrupting the framework of your device is not price you should pay for enjoying the game at its best. Although, there are other safer and more reliable solutions to making the iPogo app run better on your iOS device. Let’s take a brief peak at some of them.

- **Limiting the usage of System Resources:** Let’s keep in mind that it is unwise to keep too much on your plate and rightfully so. In this case, the more applications you keep active on your shortcut bar, the lesser resources your CPU has left to allocate to the iPogo app. Therefore, close off all other unnecessary applications before launching iPogo as it is already a heavy enough application to run on its own.
- **Too many Items opened:** Keep a tight check on your list of inventory while playing Pokémon Go using iPogo. Remember to delete all un-required collected items as it may be taking up too much space and wasting precious system resources.
- **Keep you Device Clean:** Not essentially in the literal sense but yes, it is indeed important to clean up your device often. Use a cleaner app that deletes and clears all those extra cache files that becomes the primary reason of system lag on your iOS device.
- **Install the Official Version:** It may be tempting for anyone to install the app using shortcut hacks, but that’s all they are – just hacks! Installing iPogo seem like the long way but it is the right way on all accounts. There are three methods you can use to integrate the official iPogo app, all of which has been made more simplified.

**Method 1:** Use the three-step app installation method which is direct and free to use.

**Method 2:** If you are opting for a matrix installation, in which case you will need a PC installed with either Windows, LINUX or MacOS.

**Method 3:** The Signulous method is a premium mod that gives the player access to additional features.

**Note:** All of these installation methods have specific varied requirements which must be checked appropriately.

## Part 2: A better alternative for iPogo - virtual location

If using the iPogo mod to enhance your gaming experience on Pokémon Go seem less appealing with all the added hassle then there is a better alternative for you to use. You can employ a much simpler and easier to install GPS mocking application like Wondershare’s [Dr.Fone Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/). It offers amazing user-friendly features like speed modulation, joystick control and map routing with none of the drawbacks that you had to previously overcome. It is a highly efficient virtual location tool that can be used to conveniently spoof your location without running the risk of detection on a GPS based game like Pokémon Go.

### Primary Features of Dr. Fone

- Adjust the speed of travel with three speed modes, like walking, cycling or even driving.
- Manually move your GPS on the map freely using a virtual joystick in a 360 degree direction.
- Simulate your avatar’s movements to travel on a determined route of your choice.

![Pokemon go hacks 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_1.jpg)


## Part 1: What is the Point of Trainer Battles in Pokémon Go?

The best part is that the teams are assembled by the trainers themselves. The point of the trainer battles is that a winning team is chosen while competing with the other players. The trainer battles Pokémon Go also lets the trainers choose the best players that would charge and power up Pokémon. Different spoils are embedded within the trainer battles and they all are worth trying. Once the trainer battles he is rewarded three times per day as a normal team leader. As an AI team leader, you can get the reward once every day.

![Pokemon go hacks 2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/Pokemon_go_hacks_2.jpg)

Now you want to make sure that the charged attacks are learned and how they can be used as a weapon against the other players. The Pokémon should also be chosen as per the ability as different Pokémon have different charged attack ability overall. The Pokémon is of a different kind as all benefit from the charge attack in different states. It also means that you get to choose Pokémon like Tyranitar which will get you to through the battle with highly advanced skills. Typhlosion is a dual-type Pokémon and the raids which are done using it benefit the trainers as compared to single types.

## Part 2: What can you get from trainer battles Pokémon go?

This part will deal with the rewards which the trainers will get for the battles which they will fight. There are three different types of rewards that you can win when it comes to trainer battles. These are as follows:

- Stardust
- As of January 2019, the Rare Candy reward has also been introduced to make the battles more enchanting.
- 1 in 7 chance of Sinnoh Stone.

No matter that you win or lose a battle these rewards are credited to your account. If you are playing with a computer the threshold to get the rewards is 1. If you are competing with the other players then the rewards can be earned thrice per day. Both the participants will get the same rewards but the abilities are different depending on the fact that whether you are a winner or loser. The Ace trainer medal and its acquaintance will also get the level up with each battle that you win. The other three medals will also get a level up as per a blog post from Niantic. These medals are as follows:

- Great League Veteran
- Ultra League Veteran
- Master League Veteran.

The rematches that are done in the trainer battles also account for the leveling up in all the medals as well as the other rewards that are explained.

## Part 3: Does CP Matter in Trainer Battles?

In Pokémon trainer battle it indeed matters and this is one of the basic phenomena that will take you and your team to the next level. The CP stands for combat power and it means the power of your Pokémon. As a trainer when you battle more and more the XP increases and the CP as well. This CP will also help you to get a step ahead of others in terms of Pokémon that you own. The candies are used to make sure that the CP of the Pokémon is increased. It also means that you get the best Pokémon on the battlefield that will be able to counter offense the other Pokémon on the field. There are two ways to get higher CP. Firstly you can evolve a Pokémon and secondly you can also power up an existing Pokémon. Both are the choices and the result is completely up to you. Use candies and power up your Pokémon to a higher level. It will also ensure that you get the best results on the battlefield. The weight and the size of the Pokémon also affect the CP score so you need a Pokémon that is both agile and lightweight to get the best results.

## How Do You Get Sun Stone Evolutions in Pokémon For Realme V30T?

![pokémon go sun stone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions.jpg)

Though you can certainly catch some powerful Pokémon in Pokémon Go just by playing the game, exploring the wilderness, and joining raids, it’s not enough. Evolving your Pokémon is how you advance through the game, level up, and become a better catcher.

Now, while some of your Pokémon in the game can evolve with the utmost ease, others require a bit more of a special touch, and that special touch comes in the form of evolution items. Necessary for certain species of Pokémon, evolution items can be somewhat elusive – one of the rarer ones being the Sun Stone.

**Pokémon Go Sun Stone evolutions** can improve your entire in-game experience, so learn all about them below.

## Part 1. What Are Sun Stones in Pokémon Go?

![sun stone and four pokémon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-2.jpg)

The Sun Stone is one of eight evolution items you’ll need in Pokémon Go. Glowing bright red and orange, it is effortless to recognize in the game, immediately catching your eye even in the busiest of environments. Consider yourself lucky if you come across one casually.

## Part 2. Pokémon Go Sun Stone Evolutions Explained

![five of the evolution items in pokémon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-3.jpg)

Evolutions in Pokémon Go aren’t always the same. You’ll most commonly get species-specific candy used for evolutions whenever you catch a specific Pokémon. Depending on the species, you’ll need more or less candy to evolve them. (And don’t worry, evolutions don’t affect the total number of Pokémon in your collection).

Depending on the specific Pokémon you want to evolve, you might need additional items or even need to perform a particular task. Some Pokémon will need to be walked as your Buddy Pokémon before they can evolve. Others can be evolved through trading them. Others can only evolve with the help of evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pokémon Sun Stone evolutions will require you to collect the Sun Stone and a certain amount of candy (which can vary by Pokémon).

You can always check out how to evolve your Pokémon in your Pokédex.

## Part 3. Which Pokémon Evolve With Sun Stones?

![sunken and sunflora in pokémon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-4.jpg)

Every Pokémon you come across in the game is different, and they’ll all have varying evolution requirements. Considering how elusive the Sun Stone can be, it’s great that only a few Pokémon require it. Check out the following Pokémon Sun Stone evolution list.

### Pokémon Sun Stone Evolution List

| **Pokémon** | **Items Needed** | **Sun Stone Evolutions** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gloom | Sun Stone and 100 Oddish candy | Bellossom |
| Sunkern | Sun Stone and 50 Sunkern candy | Sunflora |
| Cottonee | Sun Stone and 50 Cottonee candy | Whimsicott |
| Petilil | Sun Stone and 50 Petilil candy | Lilligant |
| Helioptile | Sun Stone and 50 Helioptilecandy | Heliolisk |

## Part 4. How to Acquire Sun Stones on Pokémon Go

![sun stone and helioptile in pokémon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-5.jpg)

While certainly not the rarest evolution item in Pokémon Go, that title belonging to the ever-elusive Axew's Unova Stone, the Sun Stone will still make you work for it. Only the lucky few are able to come across it randomly, as it comes with a mere 1% drop chance.

Fortunately, for all those unlucky ones, you can acquire the Sun Stone to complete your Pokémon evolutions in a few different ways.

### Special Events

Partaking in Pokémon Go special events is almost always a lucrative experience. You can get excellent XP bonuses, come across special Pokémon, enjoy more candy and stardust, encounter special raid bosses, and so much more. Of course, you can also increase your chances of encountering rare evolution items like the Sun Stone.

Pokémon Go will frequently have multiple special events happening every month. Some of the events happening in February 2024 include:

- Lunar New Year – February 5 to February 11;
- Carnival of Love – February 13 to February 15;
- Road to Sinnoh – February 19 to February 23.

You’ll be notified of any ongoing special events as soon as you start your game, so check your phone at least once daily. While partaking in a special event doesn’t guarantee you’ll get a Sun Stone, there’s always a possibility!

### Field Research

Throughout your game, Professor Willow will need your help to learn more about Pokémon, so he’ll send you on different research tasks. Of course, you’ll always be generously rewarded for your efforts.

Among the different types of research the professor sends you is field research. You can collect your field research tasks by spinning the Photo Disc at a PokéStop. You can only collect and work on three field research tasks simultaneously, though a fourth one will open if you receive bonus research. Moreover, you and your friends can work together to complete the same field research if you all go to the same PokéStop on the same day.

As you’re completing your field research tasks, you can collect your rewards, earn stamps, and unlock breakthroughs. Hopefully, one of the rewards you receive will include the Sun Stone, allowing you to evolve some of your Pokémon.

### Special Research

With field research, you have some flexibility. You can visit PokéStops when you’re up for them, and you can even discard some tasks if they’re too difficult for you. With special research, you don’t have all that much flexibility.

Professor Willow will contact you directly and give you specific tasks you must complete. You can’t disregard or discard them.

As a rule, special research will be more involved and will likely last longer than field research. However, your rewards will usually be much more valuable, and you’ll exponentially increase your chances of obtaining a Sun Stone.

### Gyms and PokeStops

Of course, you can always earn valuable rewards by simply visiting gyms and PokéStops and spinning the Photo Discs. Create a 7-day PokéStop streak, as that will guarantee you’ll get an evolution item.

While you’ll usually get a more common evolution item after your 7-day streak, you might get a Sun Stone or something even more valuable.

Usually, it’s in your best interest to go to more popular areas with more PokéStops, as you’ll be able to make more spins faster.

## Part 5. How to Gather Sun Stones Efficiently

![Text” sun stone in pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/03/sun-stone-evolutions-6.jpg)

Field research, special research, and spinning gyms and PokéStops are the only ways you could acquire the Sun Stone in Pokémon Go. However, that doesn’t mean you’ll need to grind day in and day out, trying to explore as much of your neighborhood as possible while playing. You can always make things a bit more efficient than that.

### Complete Field Research Tasks Quickly

Mention Dr. Fone Virtual Location and Add Steps.

To complete field research and increase your chances of getting a Sun Stone, you’ll usually have to spend a lot of your time wandering around your neighborhood. After all, Pokémon Go is a location-based game that requires you to go out into town and wander the streets of your city. There’s virtually no task you can complete from the comfort of your home unless you have an ace up your sleeve.

Wondershare Dr.Fone virtual location can be a game-changer for completing your field research tasks quickly. A tool designed to spoof your location and make it seem like you’re out and about while you’re actually just relaxing at home, it can help you finish your field research without much fuss.

You can use the Dr. Fone virtual location to set your location to anywhere in the world. Create a one-stop or multi-stop route to make the game believe you’re moving around, or even use the jump-teleport mode to “transfer” to a more resource-rich location. However, be careful with the jump-teleport mode, as it can betray the fact that you’re using a location spoofer.

To get started with Wondershare Dr.Fone and complete your field research tasks, you must follow a few steps:



1. Download and launch Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer;
2. Connect your phone to your computer;
3. Go to **Toolbox > Virtual Location > Get Started**;

![get started with wondershare dr.fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

4. On the map that shows up, click on **No Device**in the upper right-hand corner;
5. You’ll see a list of all connected devices, select your phone;

![choose the Realme V30T device you want to connect to dr.fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-1.png)

6. On your phone, tap **Allow USB Debugging**;
7. On your phone, go to **Developer Options> Select mock location app**;
8. Select **Fone**.

![set up mock location on your phone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/vl-connect-android-3.png)

From there, you can easily set up your route, change your location, and simulate movement. With Wondershare Dr.Fone, you’ll have intuitive keyboard controls, 360-degree directions, and automated movement. So, as soon as you set things up in the app, you can start playing the game, completing your field research tasks, and, hopefully, acquiring your Sun Stones.

### Pay Attention to Community Days and Special Events

Finally, to start getting Sun Stones and other rarer items more efficiently, you’ll always want to pay close attention to community days and special events. Pokémon Go is a very active game with frequent high-rewarding events that could happen at any time. Since these events are time-limited, you’ll always want to know precisely when they start and end.

Fortunately, finding this out is pretty easy. Just keep track of Pokémon Go on social media or visit the official Pokémon Go website to find out more. All events will be announced ahead of time so that you can prepare.

## Conclusion

Acquiring Sun Stones for Pokémon evolutions can be quite a hassle. This rare evolution item can be a tricky find. Still, simply playing the game and joining all events, completing your research tasks, and more can significantly increase your chances of coming across a Sun Stone – especially if you have the help of apps like Wondershare Dr.Fone.
