In this guide, I will teach you how to use reliable Android Pokemon Go spoof apps and the risks related to them.

![Pokemon Go spoofing apps for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Why so many people seek Pokemon Go spoofing on Android?

Before we discuss various Android Pokemon Go spoof solutions, it is important to cover the basics. As you know, Pokemon Go is based on augmented reality and encourages us to move around to catch more Pokemons. To do this, users go out, visit parks, cafes, and tons of different places. Though, there would come a time when you would exhaust all the nearby Pokemons.

If you want to have more Pokemons in your collection or visit different gyms, then you need to do Pokemon Go GPS spoof on Android. This will make the app believe that you are somewhere else and would unlock more Pokemons for you. Needless to say, you can spoof Pokemon Go at the convenience of your home and would not have to travel to different places to extend your collection.

## Part 2: Must-know Risks for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing in 2020

A while back, Niantic realized that a lot of people are misusing the app by exploiting Android's features to change their location. To control the Pokemon Go spoofing on Android, Niantic has come up with the three-strike policy.

- If the company would detect that you are using a Pokemon Go spoofer for Android, then it will give you the first strike (shadowban). You would still be able to play the game but won't sight a rare Pokemon for the next 7 days.
- The next strike is pretty dangerous (temp ban), as it would block your account for a month. After almost 30 days, you can restore your account.
- The third (and the last strike) would permanently block your account. Though, if you think your account has been suspended by mistake, then you can appeal Niantic to revoke your account.

## Part 3: 3 Best Methods for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing

As you can see, if you are using any unreliable Pokemon Go spoofing app on Android, then it can even get your account suspended. Not just that, it can also harm your device and make it vulnerable to security threats. To help you pick the best spoofing app for Pokemon Go Android, we have handpicked the 3 most secure options here. Let's explore these Pokemon Go spoofing solutions for Android in 2019.

### 3.1 Use a VPN

A Virtual Private Network is still considered as the safest bet to spoof Pokemon Go on Android. Firstly, it will hide your original IP address while changing your location so that you can access other Pokemons. Since most of the VPNs would encrypt your data, it will also minimize your risks of getting blocked by Pokemon Go. Apart from changing your location, it will also let you play Pokemon Go if the gaming app is not available in your region.

Some of the Virtual Private Networks that I have tried are Express VPN, Nord VPN, and IP Vanish. Most of these VPNs work similarly and have user-friendly Android applications. You can select from the available servers to spoof your location and protect your IP address at the same time. Here's how you can use a VPN to do Pokemon Go spoofing on Android.

**Step 1.** Install Pokemon Go on your Realme GT 5 Pro and create your account if you haven't already. Also, install a secure VPN like IP Vanish and have an active account. Most of the VPNs provide a free trial period as well.

**Step 2.** Close the Pokemon Go app from running in the background so that it can't detect the presence of a VPN. Now, launch a VPN app and go to the list of the servers that it provides. From here, just select the appropriate location (country or city) where Pokemon Go is already active.

**Step 3.** Once the VPN has started working, it will automatically spoof your location. Now, launch Pokemon Go on the Realme GT 5 Pro device again and access the new location.

### 3.2 Use Fake GPS Go

If you have an Android device, you can use tons of fake GPS apps to spoof your location on Pokemon Go. Most of these apps would not even need root access on the Realme GT 5 Pro device. You can just unlock the Developer Options on your Realme GT 5 Pro and enable the mock location feature from it. Fake GPS Go is a freely available application that will let you pin your location to any desired place. This will let you spoof Pokemon Go on Android pretty easily without getting detected.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your phone's Settings > System > About Phone and tap on the "Build Number" option seven consecutive times. This will unlock the Developer Options on your phone.

![Fake GPS Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-4.jpg)

**Step 2.** Now, install and launch the Fake GPS Go app on your device and grant it the needed access. Later, go to the Realme GT 5 Pro device's Settings > Developer Options and turn it on. From the Mock Location App feature, select Fake GPS Go and give it the access to change your device's location.

![select Fake GPS Go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/android-pokemon-go-spoofing-5.jpg)

If you want, you can even close Fake GPS Go so that Pokemon Go won't detect its presence. Don't worry – it will keep running in the background until you would manually launch it and stop the location spoof feature.

### 3.3 Use Fake GPS Free

This is another fake GPS app that is available for free and can easily be used on your Android. The app is pretty lightweight and won't access a lot of device usage as well. Even though the app has released a new version lately, some users have complained of getting a Niantic strike by using it. Therefore, you can use this Pokemon Go spoofing app Android at your own risk.

**Step 1.** Firstly, go to your device's settings and unlock the Developer Options by tapping on the Build Number 7 times. Also, go to Play Store and download Fake GPS Free on your device.

**Step 2.** Once the app is installed, go to Settings > Developer Options and tap on the mock location app feature to grant Fake GPS free the needed access.

**Step 4.** Once the location is spoofed, you will get the relevant notification. Close the GPS app now and launch Pokemon Go instead to access the new location on the gaming app.
