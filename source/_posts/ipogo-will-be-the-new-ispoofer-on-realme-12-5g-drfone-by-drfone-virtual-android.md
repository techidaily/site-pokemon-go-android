## iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Realme 12 5G?

If you are a sincere Pokemon Go player who sticks by the rules and plays the game, then you probably don’t know how hard it is to eliminate a location spoofer from the picture. The game attains new spheres and seems more interesting with a location spoofer involved. If you are an iOS user or an Android enthusiast who is eager for iSpoofer’s return or worried about iSpoofer Pogo not working, then this might just be the right article for you.

## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

![iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg)

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

![iOS-App-Store-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg)

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

![VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg)

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account. Here are the simple steps that you need to follow to work with [Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) for spoofing location

## Part 3 - Tips to avoid being Banned

- You need to give enough time for the cool down. This means, as soon as you change your location, wait for a few minutes before you can play the game again so that the ‘vigilante’ does not catch this abrupt change.
- Try not to use apps that are too amateur, having fake reviews on Google/App stores because these will be too vulnerable and detectable.
- If you are not sure where to spoof, then there are certain safe co-ordinates that lon term gamers of Pokemon Go suggest so you can opt for them. They are just for starters until you find your way through
- Try not to make abrupt location changes - keep it nearby initially and slowly try to increase your radius. An abrupt change can draw attention.

![Quick tips-for-no-ban-pic-10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/Quick%20tips-for-no-ban-pic-10.jpg)

That being said, there aren’t any well-researched and ground rules as to how your spoofing should be so that you remain undetected. All we can do is pick up tips from someone else’s expertise. Apps like Dr.Fone will help you change your [virtual location](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) without getting your account banned as they are designed to do this very job with perfection.

## Way 1: Use an iOS Location Spoofer

An iOS location spoofer is one of the best ways to learn Pokemon Go hatch eggs without walking.

To learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), the following steps can be taken.

**_Step 1: Connect your device and launch the app_**

Firstly, just connect your iPhone to the application and launch the Wondershare Dr.Fone > Virtual Location feature.

![launch the Dr.Fone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

Just agree to the terms and click on the "Get Started" button to launch the interface of Virtual Location and start Pokemon Go how to hatch eggs at home.

![launch Virtual Location](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**_Step 2: Walk between two stops_**

As the interface would be launched, you can see five different modes in the top-right corner. Just click on the third option (One-stop route) and look for any location from the search bar.

![walk mode](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

Now you can just select the number of times you wish to move and complete other settings, such as enabling the realistic and fluctuation mode. After that, click on the "Move Here" button.

![confirm marching](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

_**Tips:**  
1\. **Realistic Mode:** It enhances the realism of the simulation by fluctuating the speed during the simulation.  
2\. **Fluctuation Mode**: This feature enables you to move around within a 5-meter range after reaching your destination, instead of remaining static. This helps to make the GPS location change more realistic, making it less likely for Pokemon Go to detect the use of the virtual location._

This will just start the simulation, and you can even adjust the speed from a slider at the bottom.

![start the simulation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

**_Step 3: Move along multiple spots_**

Using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS), you can also simulate an entire route between multiple spots as well. To do this, just click on the "Multi-stop route" which is the fourth option in the top-right corner of the interface.

![route between multiple spots](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

Now, you can mark multiple spots on the map and can also select the number of times you wish to take this route. Click on the "Start Moving" button to start **Pokemon Go hatch eggs without walking**.

![start walking](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-12.png)

In the end, your location would be changed as the simulation would make Pokemon Go believe that you are taking the subsequent route. You can also change your walking speed from a slider as well.

In this way, you can learn how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking at the convenience of your home!

## Way 2: Use an Android Location Spoofer

This is one of the quickest ways to learn how to hatch Pokemon Go eggs without walking. If you own an Android device, then you can simply use a GPS spoofing app to manually change the location of your device. This will trick Pokemon Go into believing that you are walking instead. For iPhone users, the feature would need a jailbroken device though.

While changing your location, make sure that you do it tactfully. For instance, if an egg would need 10 kilometers of walking, then change your location gradually instead of just switching it in one go. Here’s **how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking** by using a GPS spoofer.

1. Firstly, unlock your Realme 12 5G and go to its Settings > About Phone to tap the Build Number field 7 times. This will unlock the Developer Options settings on your Android.

    ![unlock the Developer Options settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-2.jpg)

2. Now, go to the Play Store and install a reliable location spoofing app on your phone. Later, visit Settings > Developer Options and turn it on. Also, allow mock locations on the phone and choose the installed app from here.

    ![location spoofing app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-3.jpg)

3. That’s it! Now you can just launch the fake GPS app and manually change your location to a few meters away to trick Pokemon Go. Do the same a few times to cover a prominent distance.

    ![change your location to a few meters away](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-4.jpg)

Just be sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect that you are using a GPS spoofer to hatch eggs. The regular use of an app like this might result in your account ban.

## Way 3: Fix Your Realme 12 5G on a Drone and Play Pokemon Go

Apart from a location spoofing app, there are a handful of other ways to learn how to hatch eggs without walking in Pokemon Go. Most of the eggs in Pokemon Go would need you to walk 2, 5, or 10 kilometers. The good news is that an average drone can easily cover this distance. Firstly, get a working drone on which you can easily place your phone. It is recommended to get a lock so that your device won’t fall while it is on a drone. Once your phone is successfully attached to a drone, just use it to cover a substantial distance. Make sure that the speed is minimal so that Pokemon Go would believe that you are walking instead.

![Play Pokemon Go with a drone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-5.jpg)

**Things to Remember**

- While doing so, don’t forget about the safety of your phone as it can get stolen by someone if it goes too far.
- Use a lock and make sure that your phone won’t fall from your drone.
- Enable the Find My Realme 12 5G service on your Realme 12 5G or iPhone so that you can locate your phone if it is lost.
- Move your drone slowly so that Pokemon Go would not detect that you are using a drone or playing the game while driving.

## Way 4: Exchange the Friend Code of Other Pokemon Go Users

A while back, Pokemon Go enabled the option to add friends on the app and send them gifts. Presently, we can send gifts to 20 other friends from our account in a day. Therefore, if you have a lot of friends, then you can send them eggs, including the exclusive 7 km egg. There are tons of online sources and forums for people to exchange their friend codes for Pokemon Go.

1. Firstly, Launch Pokemon Go on your phone and go to your profile. Adjacent to the “Me” section, tap on the “Friends” section instead.

    ![go to your profile](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-6.jpg)

2. Here, you can see a list of your friends and an option to add more friends on Pokemon Go. To add a friend, you need to enter their code which can be obtained from any dedicated forum or even Reddit.
3. That’s it! Once you have added a friend, go to their profile, and choose to trade or send them a gift. For instance, you can send them an exclusive egg and help them hack eggs without walking.

    ![help friends hack eggs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-7.jpg)

**Pro-Tip**

If you have a friend who goes for a jog or walks a lot, then you can just open Pokemon Go on their phone and let them cover the distance for you as well!

## Way 5: Use Your Pokecoins to Purchase More Incubators

You might already know that Pokecoins is the official currency of Pokemon Go. Using it, you can buy all kinds of tools, incense, eggs, incubators, and even Pokemons. Though, if you wish to learn how to hack eggs in Pokemon Go without moving, then consider getting some incubators. There are all kinds of incubators available in the game that can help you hatch eggs without walking much.

1. Firstly, make sure that you have enough Pokecoins with you. If not, launch the app and tap on the Pokeball from its home to visit its shop.
2. From here, you can buy as many Pokecoins as you want. For instance, $0.99 would let you purchase 100 Pokecoins.

    ![get Pokecoins](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-8.jpeg)

3. Great! Once you have enough Pokecoins, go to the Shop again and choose to buy eggs and incubators.
4. After getting enough incubators, you can go to your collection and apply more incubators to hatch eggs without walking.

    ![apply more incubators](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-9.jpg)

## Way 6: Make Use of Your Bike or Skateboard

This is one of the oldest tricks in the book to learn **how to hatch eggs in Pokemon Go without walking**. You can just place your phone carefully on your bike or skateboard and cover the needed distance to hatch more eggs. While you would still have to go out for this, the effort needed would be far less than walking.

Just make sure that you stay safe while riding your bike or skateboard. Don’t focus too much on catching new Pokemons. Instead, just cover the needed distance to hatch the egg. Also, ride your bike or skateboard slowly to make sure Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement.

![play Pokemon Go with Bike or Skateboard](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-10.jpg)

## Way 7: Use a Roomba while Playing Pokemon Go

If you have a Roomba or any other robotic cleaner in the house, then you can also take its assistance to hack Pokemon Go eggs. All you got to do is place your phone on the Roomba and let it move around in your house. Since the robotic cleaner would move slowly, it will make Pokemon Go believe that you are walking instead. Just be sure that your phone will stay safe and protected. I would recommend placing it in a waterproof lock to further protect it from any wear and tear.

![play Pokemon Go with Roomba](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-11.jpg)

## Way 8: Create a Model Railroad to Play Pokemon Go

If you are already into model railroads, then you won’t face any issues playing Pokemon Go. It would be the replica of a big railroad with miniature trains. Simply place your phone on a miniature train and let it revolve around the railroad to cover the distance. Just keep your phone safe and regulate the speed of the train to make sure that Pokemon Go won’t detect any fast movement. You would have to drive your train for a while to cover the distance, but you don’t have to walk to do it.

![Model Railroad](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2019/09/hatch-pokemon-eggs-without-walking-12.jpg)

## Way 9: Use A Turntable to Hatch Eggs without Walking Pokemon Go

Do you have a turntable? If yes, you are lucky! You can use it that you used to listen to music to trick Pokemon Go that you're walking and hatch the eggs. Because the turntable creates enough motion in a wide enough circle that it will trick your phone's internal sensors into thinking you're walking. This trick is for anyone who wants to be a quick hatch in Pokemon Go! Here are the steps:

Place your phone on the outermost edge of the turntable > Turn on the turntable > Confirm if your eggs are starting to hatch. If not, readjust your device and try again.

## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pokémon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pokémon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pokémon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

Yes, you read it right! With [Pokemon Go spoofing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), you can catch powerful characters in less time.

In the following parts, we will discuss in detail the possible ways to catch Pokémon Go IV 100 on the map, including location spoofer.

Keeping reading!

## Part 2: How to Check the IVs of Pokémon?

Before you put effort into catching the Pokémon IV 100 map, you should have knowledge about which Pokémon has a stat of 100 IV. Following are the ways with which you can check the IVs of Pokémon in the Pokémon Go game.

### 2.1 Check IVs within the app

You can check the true percentages of your characters’ IVs in the gaming app itself. Now, if you use the appraisal system of the app, your team leader will show the stats of each Pokémon and can give it a star rating as well.

Further, you can also click on the arrows on the left and right to see the stats of the next Pokémon.

### 2.2 Know Pokémon IV using search filters

![know pokemon iv](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-2.jpg)

Pokémon Go app has a search feature that you can use to know the exact IV of Pokémon. To do this, tap the search icon present at the top of your Pokémon menu. Now in the search bar, type the name of any Pokémon, say type “shiny”. This will show all the shiny mons with different star ratings.

Now check the Pokémon by their star rating, as this is the easy way to know about the IVs of characters. Type “4\*” in the search bar, and you will see characters with a 4-star rating. Mostly a star Pokémon are a 100 IV Pokémon map.

Since 100 IV Pokémon are so sought-after, catching them can be a tough job. Apart from using a **Pokémon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a “lucky” Pokémon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.
