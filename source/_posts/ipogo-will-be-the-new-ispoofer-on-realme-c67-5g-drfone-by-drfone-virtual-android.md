## Part 1 - Why am I unable to download iSpoofer for Pogo?

iSpoofer was discontinued two years ago, around 2019 and still remains out of action. This could possibly be because Pokemon Go makers have banned the application. The main target customers for iSpoofer were the PoGo players and having them gone, there is not much the app can offer.

![iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-for-Android-and-iOS-pic-1.jpg)

The initial version remains unsupportive and shows ‘Maintenance’ pop up while you cannot download any new versions from their website. It still contains the old links on the site which are of no use to the current players. Tackling with too much will also result in account ban as Pokemon Go has strict rules that no third party applications will be entertained.

Since we haven’t heard from iSpoofer in 2020, we can assume that they won’t be here for long and it would be a wise choice to look for alternatives.

## Part 2 - How to Find other alternatives for the iSpoofer

![iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iSpoofer-PoGo-pic-2.jpg)

It is hard to handle change especially when you are an iPhone user. There aren’t many apps that you can find on the App Store and you never know their authenticity. Even if you find a good location spoofer, you never know how long that is going to keep your location changed or if it will remain undetected. That being said - your first obvious option for spoofing Pokemon Go would be -

### Any App from the Apple App Store

If the iSpoofer for Pogo is not working, then you can make a simple search for some other GPS location changer on the App store and they would help you for a short time. If you are lucky then they might remain undetected for a very long time. However, we won’t suggest this to be the most stable option so we can move ahead to the next best thing for the iOS users.

![iOS-App-Store-pic-3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/iOS-App-Store-pic-3.jpg)

### In-built spoofing with VPNs

Virtual Private Networks are known for masking your IP on the world wide web but what most of you don’t know is that they can also spoof your location. But this is only restricted to a few VPN applications that have the feature. SurfShark and ExpressVPn are two of the most affordable and efficient VPNs that you can consider for your iOS devices.

The spoofer will help you play Pokemon Go for sure though I cannot give you assurance about other games in the market. However, the detection rate is a problem because Pokemon Go is capable of detecting these VPNs and blocking your account if you don’t play your cards well. That is, you need to be careful about where you are ‘changing’ your location to (not too far).

![VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/VPN-Pokemon-GO-pic-4.jpg)

If you are looking for something long lasting and something that won’t pose a detection problem, then I would suggest you to go for WOnder share’s Dr.Fone. It is affordable, has some remarkable features and works great for both Android and iOS devices.

Unlike iSpoofer, this will not require jailbreak access, detects every location on the globe and poses no threat to your Pokemon Go account. Here are the simple steps that you need to follow to work with [Dr.Fone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/fake-snapchat-location.html) for spoofing location
