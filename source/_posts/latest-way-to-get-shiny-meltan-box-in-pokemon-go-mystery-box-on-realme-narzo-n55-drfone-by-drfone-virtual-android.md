You can use the faux location of [Dr. Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to imitate your orientation without making a move and collect exclusive Pokémon. The mock location of Dr.Fone lets you simulate your position and permits your mobile application to presume that you have selected the application interface of Dr.Fone without any restrain or recognition from developers of Pokémon Go. Follow the instructions below to catch Pokémon any place without making any movement.

**Step 1: Install:**

Install the ‘Dr. Fone toolkit’ from the official website after downloading it. After installation, launch the toolkit and select the ‘Virtual Location’ tab.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2: Connect:**

Subsequently, connect your PC or laptop with the Dr. Fone application. Also, permit the location services to retrieve the location of your device. Then, press on the ‘Get Started’ button to use the services of Dr. Fone.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 3: Imitate your GPS position:**

Select your current location on the map. Next, click the leftmost button on the top-right corner of the window to start the ‘Teleport’ mode. Then search the places you wish to mock your position with, and press ‘Go’ after the selection.

![virtual location 8](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

**Step 4: Imitate Movement between steps:**

To start the simulation, make a movement and traverse to the ‘Move Here’ button to reach multiple times. By default, the motion is adjusted to ‘1’, but it can be replaced by the user to switch the program correspondingly.

![virtual location 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The simulated position will emerge as genuine for the Pokémon Go app, and it will believe that you are moving between the two designated positions chosen on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the motion speed can also be tuned using the sliding menu. This way, you can use the false maneuver of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without having the need to understand it. Also, your application will not be banned.

![virtual location 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 5: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also permits you to replicate activity between more than two sites. The component is called after the multi-stop path that can be chosen from the GUI toolbox class positioned at the top-right nook that lets you put numerous specified destinations on the map, and your position will behave appropriately as controlled by the virtual location application of Dr.Fone.

To grant permission to the system to mock movement by picking out the right options, press the 'March' button. You will be required to do the Pokémon Go walking illusion at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual movement imitation application eases your life and lets you do the job without being concerned about travel costs.

## Part 2: How to get Shiny Meltan in Pokémon Go?

It is original since each and every other Pokémon has been announced in either the main games or using the Pokémon animation. Meltan has very restricted accessibility and Meltan evolution, Melmetal can yet solely be evolved in Pokémon Go. Until now, there were only two ways of catching Meltan - transferring a Pokémon from Pokémon Go to Pokémon Home or associating your Pokémon Go account to Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee! Now there is another way of capturing Meltan, that is, by opening a mystery box. You can get a Mystery Box that opens once a week by connecting your ‘Pokémon Go’ and ‘Pokémon Home’ accounts as described earlier.

The Mystery Box will act as an essence precisely for Meltan, attracting a large amount of the small Hex Nut Pokémon to your locality for one hour. It takes time to recharge, about three days, but after it is charged, you have to transfer another Pokémon to HOME to be able to use it again for an hour. If you get to use the Mystery Box in the course of specific events, you can even grab a Shiny Meltan.

## Part 1: What Does 100 IV Mean in Pokémon Go?

IV stands for Individual Value, which depicts the overall performance of any Pokémon in the game. You can say that it is a kind of rank of Pokémon in the game. Ideally, not all Pokémon of the same species have the exact efficiencies. Any Pokémon in the game is measured by three tactics – attack, defense, and stamina. A value from 0 to 15 is allocated for all these parameters. A Pokémon with 15/15/15 perfect stats would get a 100 Individual Value.

- A Pokémon with 45/45 stats is known as a 100 IV Pokémon, as it can reach the maximum CP for its species.
- These Pokémon have a higher HP, base stats, and combat value, and just perform better than other Pokémon of lower IV.

Now, as you know what 100 IV means, we are sure that you want to catch the Pokémon with 100 IV on the map. But, for catching Pokémon 100 IV, you either need patience or wait for days, or you can do it with spoofing.

Yes, you read it right! With [Pokemon Go spoofing](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html), you can catch powerful characters in less time.

![Pokemon Go 100 IV Map introduction](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-1.jpg)

In the following parts, we will discuss in detail the possible ways to catch Pokémon Go IV 100 on the map, including location spoofer.

Keeping reading!

## Part 2: How to Check the IVs of Pokémon?

Before you put effort into catching the Pokémon IV 100 map, you should have knowledge about which Pokémon has a stat of 100 IV. Following are the ways with which you can check the IVs of Pokémon in the Pokémon Go game.

### 2.1 Check IVs within the app

You can check the true percentages of your characters’ IVs in the gaming app itself. Now, if you use the appraisal system of the app, your team leader will show the stats of each Pokémon and can give it a star rating as well.

Further, you can also click on the arrows on the left and right to see the stats of the next Pokémon.

### 2.2 Know Pokémon IV using search filters

![know pokemon iv](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-2.jpg)

Pokémon Go app has a search feature that you can use to know the exact IV of Pokémon. To do this, tap the search icon present at the top of your Pokémon menu. Now in the search bar, type the name of any Pokémon, say type “shiny”. This will show all the shiny mons with different star ratings.

Now check the Pokémon by their star rating, as this is the easy way to know about the IVs of characters. Type “4\*” in the search bar, and you will see characters with a 4-star rating. Mostly a star Pokémon are a 100 IV Pokémon map.

## Part 3: Tips to Catch 100 IV Pokémon in the Game

Since 100 IV Pokémon are so sought-after, catching them can be a tough job. Apart from using a **Pokémon Go 100 IV map**, here are other tips that can increase your chances to catch the perfect IVs Pokémon to some extent. A Weather Boosted wild catch can increase your odds to a 1 in 1,725 chance. But, this is still not so easy for a player.

![catch 100 iv pokemon](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-3.jpg)

- If you are fortunate, then you can end up [catching a “lucky” Pokémon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-ios.html). Though, the chances of a lucky Pokémon having 100 IV are 1 in 64 presently.
- Although you get only one chance in 4,096 chances to catch the high-rank character in Pokemon Go and the probability of finding perfect IVs is 0.0244% from a wild catch, you can do some research to improve your chances.
- Catching a Pokémon from a quest, hatching it from an egg, or catching it by defending a raid might also result in a 100 IV Pokémon (1 in 216 chances).
- Trading increases the chances of perfect IVs.

Trading is one way to improve the chances of catching the 100 IV Pokémon Go map. Trading Pokémon between friends can increase the odds of finding perfect IVs. Moreover, it is a great way to boost IVs, as well. The odds depend on your level of friendship.

![trading increases the chance of perfect ivs](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2023/virtuallocation/Pokemon-Go-100-IV-Map-4.jpg)

- For example, with good friend trade, the chances are 1 in 3,375
- With great friend trade, the chances are 1 in 2,744
- When you make a trade with ultra-friend, the chances are 1 in 2,197
- Last, doing trade with a best friend creates chances to catch perfect IV 1 in 1,331

But, again, trading Pokémon is not very helpful. If you only rely on trading, you may have to wait for a long time for perfect IVs.

## Part 1: What’s the Need for a Pokemon Go Joystick?

If you are an avid Pokemon Go player, then you might already know that the game demands us to step outside to catch Pokemons or participate in raids. Sadly, not everyone can travel so much on their own. Therefore, you might consider using a Pokemon Go joystick on iOS/Android under the following circumstances.

- In the current Covid-19 pandemic, you might be under a lockdown and can’t step out.
- You could have already explored your nearby areas and would like to catch more Pokemons.
- There could be any other health or environmental condition, stopping you from going out.
- The weather outside might not be suitable or safe to explore the Pokemon Go map on your own.
- Any other possible reason for not being able to travel solely or having enough time to catch Pokemons.

## Part 2: Possible Risks for Using a Pokemon Go Joystick

A Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution can easily change your present location in the game or even simulate your movement. Though, if you use the Pokemon Go joystick app multiple times a day and Niantic detects it, then it can cause some issues.

Please note that the use of any location spoofing or Pokemon Go hack (joystick) is against the terms of Niantic. Therefore, if your account is found using these hacks, then Niantic can display warning messages. If after getting multiple warnings, the hack is still being detected, then it can lead to a temporary or even a permanent ban of your account.
