- **Step 4.** **Enable the Multi-Stop Route Feature**

If you want to visit more than one stop, enable the Multi-Stop Route mode. You can do it by accessing the top-right section adjacent to the One-Stop Route mode. Once activated, designate multiple locations on the map by selecting your desired points. Specify the number of trips and speed settings. Initiate the process by clicking on "Start Moving." During the simulation, you can "Pause" the sequence at any point.
