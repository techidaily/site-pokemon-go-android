## Preparation to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go For Honor X50i+

Are you ready to defeat Giovani effortlessly in Pokemon Go? Keep reading.

Giovani is the grand commander of the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate. The big boss appears stronger every month as he also changes his lineup of creatures monthly. This means your lineup of Pokemon Go Giovani counters would have to change subsequently. So how do you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against the Team Go Rocket boss when next you meet him? Well, that's left for this guide to answer. Here you will learn about how to defeat this monster and how to find him. Without wasting your time, let's start with how to find Giovani in Pokemon.

## Part 1. How to Find the Giovani in Pokemon

Locating Giovani’s hideout is never a walk in the park as you need to complete some daunting tasks. A detailed explanation of each task is given below:

### 1\. A Troubling Situation Task

This four-step storyline Special Research task introduces players to the Team Go Rocket Invasion and Shadow Pokemon feature in the Pokemon Go game. Players leverage the task to learn how to stop the Team Go Rocket crime syndicate by reclaiming PokeStop and then purifying Shadow Pokemon.

How to Complete ’A Troubling Situation’ Task in Pokemon Go Giovani

Below you will find all the four steps you need to complete in the ‘A Troubling Situation’ task with their rewards:

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 1**

This step should be completed with ease since you aren't new to the Giovani Pokemon Go game. Just evolve any two Pokemon that you own and then charge them up five times. And boom! You are done with this step.

**Reward:** 1,000 Stardust and 2,000 XP

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 2**

For this step, you have to catch two shadow Pokemon which can be achieved by defeating two Grunts from Team Go Rocket. On killing them, they will leave some shadow Pokemon behind which you have to catch. After that, go ahead and defeat the last Grunt to complete this step.

**Reward:** 2,000 Stardust, 2,000 XP, and 5 Golden Razz Berries

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 3**

After catching the shadow Pokemon in step 2, you need to catch one more to cleanse or purify the three of them. To do this, just tap on your shadow Pokemon, and then hit the Purify option. You will be charged some thousands of Stardust and a couple of candy for the shadow Pokemon.

**Rewards:** 2000 Stardust, 5 Silver Pinap Berries, and 1 Rare Candy

**Pokemon Go: A Troubling Situation Step 4**

For this step, you’ve got nothing to do. All three objectives have been automatically completed for you when you finished the previous step. You only get rewards at this final step.

**Rewards:** One Fast TM, One Charged TM, and 3 Rare Candies

### 2\. Giovani Special Research Task

![giovani special research](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/giovani-special-research.jpg)

After completing the quest above, Giovani Special Research or Looming in the Shadows is the next and final quest you have to complete to face Giovani. It's a six-step Special Research that introduces the Team Go Rocket Grunts and Leaders: Cliff, Arlo, and Sierra.

![a troubling situation task](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/a-troubling-situation-task.jpg)

On completing one research step, you will be given a reward called the Super Rocket Radar. Like the Rocket Radar, the Super Rocket Radar can be equipped and unequipped from your Bag. This reward doesn't only show Giovani’s hideout, it also shows some of his Grunts hideouts.

## Part 2. What does the Pokemon Go Giovani Counter Contain?

Giovani remains the toughest beast amongst all the Team Go Rocket Leaders. When you find him in the game, be prepared to face his wrath. To defeat him, you need a powerful team.

The big boss choice of legendary Shadow Pokemon and second party members changes every month- the Pokemon you fought against the previous month will be different from that of the present month and thereafter.

Giovani’s lineup of creatures for October 2022 is shown below:

| Lineup of Creature | Pokemon |
| --- | --- |
| First | Persian |
| Second | Kangashkan, Nidoking, Garchomp |
| Third | Mewtwo |

For the Pokemon, Persian, and Kangashkan, try to have a Lucario, Conkeldurr, or Machamp in your team and you are good to defeat them.

When you encounter Nidoking or Garchomp, your team has to change. You will need to have a strong ice-type Pokemon on your team. The reason is that this new Lineup of creatures is strong on land and could cause substantial damage to the dragon-type Pokemon in case you wanna choose them.

Picking any of these great ice-type Pokemon, Mamoswine, Glaceon, or Weavile when you face Nidoking or Garchomp is a perfect choice. However, we recommend Mamoswine, because he isn't just an ice-type Pokemon but also a strong ground-type Pokemon.

Once you defeat Team Go Rocket's second lineup creatures, you will have to battle against the legendary psychic Pokemon, Mewtwo, who is weak to this set of Pokemon; bug, ghost, and Dark-type Pokemon. So beating this Pokemon Go Giovani grunt shouldn't be a tedious task as you’ve got a plethora of choices when deciding the Pokemon-type to use. Origin Giratina and Tyranitar are some strong Dark-type Pokemon you can use to defeat Mewtwo.

Now you know the best Giovani Pokemon Go counters to use against each lineup of creatures, leverage it to advance to the next phase of the game where you will face the big bad boss himself, Giovani.

## Part 3. Tips to Beat Giovani in Pokemon Go

![giovani](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/giovani.jpg)

Just as you did against Team Go Rocket Leaders, Arlo, Cliff, and Sierra, you need a Pokemon stronger than two of Giovani’s. With that, you can use the same Pokemon twice, thereby keeping your choice for Legendary Shadow Pokemon safe till you need it to beat Giovani.

Mind you, the big bad boss, Giovani has two Protect Shields at his disposal so you have to be careful while fighting against the monster. We implore you to start your game with a Pokemon that has a Charged move so you can charge as fast as possible.

Getting a strong Pokemon won't come with ease, however, with the use of [Dr.Fone- Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) you can achieve this.

## How to get the dragon scale and evolution-enabled pokemon On Honor X50i+?

The Dragon Scale is a special item in Pokémon Go that is used to evolve Seadra into Kingdra. To get a Dragon Scale in the game, you need to complete the 7-day Research Breakthrough. This means that you need to complete a Field Research task every day for 7 days to get the Dragon Scale. Once you have the Dragon Scale, you can use it to evolve Seadra into Kingdra.

Dragon scales in Pokémon GO are extremely exceptional and are utterly crucial in evolving pokemon. Pokemon go dragon scale evolutions can be as easy as utilizing the necessary amount of candy, but frequently scarce evolutions will call for an evolution object. These are usable that not only let you fill in your Pokedex but also gain access to many impactful beasts. There are several different ways to get a Dragon Scale, but none of them is guaranteed. This implies that you will have to accomplish as many of these tasks that are feasible – peculiarly because you can make use of them only once. Perhaps the simplest way of gaining a Dragon Scale is spinning Pokestops wherever likely. Each Pokestop comes up with a 1% probability of an evolution object, encompassing a Dragon Scale.

Following are the additional evolution items observed in Pokémon Go:

- King's Rock
- Metal Coat
- Sinnoh Stone
- Sun Stone
- Unova Stone
- Upgrade

![pokemon go](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/pokemon-go.jpg)

## Part 1：What Pokémon can I evolve with a dragon scale on Pokémon Go?

The pokemon go dragon scale is one of the new evolution objects that can be employed in association with Pokemon Candy to evolve some of the generation 1 Pokemon to new generation 2 evolutions. The dragon scale is extremely strong and rigid. We can only make use of our Dragon Scale on a specific Pokemon. Dragon scale pokemon go evolutions contain the alteration of Seadra into Kingdra by combining the dragon scale along with 100 Horsea candies - making Kingdra a sturdy pocket monster ideal for raids and taking charge over the gyms.

![seadra evolving to kingdra](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/seadra-evolving-to-kingdra.jpg)

Once receiving a Dragon Scale, a player can only use it to evolve Seadra. Any other Pokemon will not evolve with it or even need it to evolve.

## Part 2：Fast way to get the exclusive Pokémon?

You can make use of the artificial locality of [Dr. Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to imitate your position without any motion and acquire exclusive Pokémon. The duplicate point of Dr. Fone lets you phony your orientation and permits your mobile application to presume that you are chosen in the app interface of Dr. Fone without being banned from the game or getting detected by the developers of Pokemon Go. To seize the pokemon, you can trail the instructions below with one click without having to go anywhere else.

**Step 1: Replicating Position Fluke:**

Pokemon Go can be played without requiring movement, using Dr. Fone's toolkit. To replicate the position and guarantee that the iOS gadget is associated with the application, open the Virtual Location property using a functioning lightning cable.

![drfone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

You can click the ‘Get Started’ button to initiate the action as soon as your phone gets detected.

![virtual location 01](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Mirroring Motion amid steps:**

Unfold the top right area of the initial option before reaching Dr. Fone's GUI, which permits you to imitate maneuver amid the two spots. Pick the positioning pin and click on the ‘transfer here’ button in the search bar.

![virtual location 08](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-08.png)

To begin the replication, you will be required to make a movement and traverse the 'March' button to reach it multiple times. By default, the action is set to one but can be outweighed by the user, and the plan will change correspondingly.

![virtual location 09](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-09.png)

The change location will act as genuine for the Pokémon Go application, and it will presume that the player is moving in between the two points you chose on the Dr. Fone GUI screen. At the foot of the screen, the rate of motion can also be modified, making use of the gliding menu. By following these steps, you can use the fake motion of the position of Dr. Virtual Fone without needing to understand it, and your app will not be banned.

![virtual location 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-10.png)

![virtual location 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-11.png)

**Step 3: Movement Simulation between more than two spots:**

Dr. Fone's application also lets you fake your motion joining more than two positions. The attribute is called after the multi-stop path that can be highlighted from the GUI toolbox class situated at the top-right position, which allows you to release several accurate endpoints on the map, and your position will take action correspondingly as managed by the virtual position application of Dr. Fone.

To let the system duplicate flow by choosing the accurate choices, press the 'March' button. You will have to do the Pokémon Go walking trick at some point. Dr. Fone's virtual motion replicator application makes your life a lot easier and lets you do the job without having to worry about travel charges.

## Part 3: How to get the dragon scale on Pokémon Go?

Pokemon go dragon scale can be obtained by taking charge of Gyms and spinning, waiting for the Pokestops to give you free dragon scales, but the chances are extremely low. PokeStops are symbolized by little blue box images on the map and usually can be observed in places of recreation such as a train station, a landmark, or even a regional post office. When your avatar is near to entering a PokeStop, the blue box image changes into a disc shape. The next thing you need to do is tap the disc, and it will exhibit a picture of the landmark, which is a chance to get a few free products.

You can get your hands on a dragon scale by spinning a specific Pokestop seven days in a row to get the required streak bonus. This won't ensure you a dragon scale; however, it will give you the possibility of achieving other evolutionary objects such as the Sun Stone, Upgrade, Sinnoh Stone, Unova Stone, Metal Coat, and King's Rock.

## Conclusion

Specific Pokémon in Pokémon GO now call for rare evolution items such as a steel coat, a sunstone, a king's rock, a dragon scale, or an upgrade to evolve, all of which are unplanned drops from Pokestops. However, the players can make use of [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) application to gain version exclusive Pokemon and evolution items and make advancements in the game.
