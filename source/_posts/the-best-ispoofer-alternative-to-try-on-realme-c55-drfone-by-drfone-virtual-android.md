## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Realme C55

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your iPhone location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

![pokemon go account warning](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/pokemon-go-account-warning.jpg)

### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

You can follow these simple steps to use this iSpoofer alternative to change your iPhone location easily.

**Step 1: Connect your iPhone to the system**

To begin with, you can connect your iPhone to the system and launch the Dr.Fone – Virtual Location on it. Now, agree to its terms and click on the “Get Started” button.

![virtual location 1](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-01.png)

**Step 2: Enter the target location**

Once your iPhone is detected, the interface will display its present location. You can now click on the teleport mode icon from the top.

![virtual location 3](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-03.png)

![virtual location 04](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-04.png)

**Step 3: Spoof your iPhone location**

As you would select the target location, the application will automatically change the interface. You can now drag the pin around and even zoom in/out the map to select the target location.

![virtual location 7](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/virtual-location-07.png)

**Note:** Keep in mind the cooldown duration before changing your location to ensure your account won’t get banned by Niantic while using the location spoofer. For instance, wait for a few minutes and only change your location realistically.



## Part 3: How to Spoof your Realme C55 Device’s Location for Pokemon Go?

Unlike iOS devices, it is pretty easy to spoof location in Android devices. This is because Google allows us to mock the location of our device using any reliable mobile app (unlike Apple). Therefore, if you are looking for an iSpoofer alternative for Android devices, you can follow these basic instructions.

**Step 1: Enable the Mock Location feature**

At first, you need to turn on the Developer Options to enable the Mock Location feature. For this, go to your phone’s Settings > About Phone and tap the “Build Number” seven times to turn on Developer Options.

![enable developer options](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/enable-developer-options.jpg)

Great! Now you can go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and turn on the Mock Location option.

![allow mock locations](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/allow-mock-locations.jpg)

**Step 2: Install a Mock Location App**

Afterward, you can go to the Play Store and install any reliable mock location app from developers like Hola or Lexa. Let’s suppose we have installed the Mock GPS app by Lexa on the Realme C55 device.

![fake gps lexa](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/fake-gps-lexa.jpg)

Once the app has been downloaded, you can again go to your phone’s Settings > Developer Options and set the app as a default tool to spoof your location.

![select mock location app](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/select-mock-location-app.jpg)

**Step 3: Change your device’s location**

That’s it! Now you can launch the mock location app and enter the address or coordinates of any target location. You can further adjust the pin and drop it anywhere you like to spoof the Realme C55 device’s location.
