However, a slightly higher CP brings more legendaries appearances that you have been catching in Raids or weekly Research for years.

For your help, here are the trios for your better understanding of the building up of a team. Consider following as examples-

- Mew and Giratina are in the majority of triumphing compositions. Suicune is replaceable with Cressida, Alolan Muk, Dragonite, Registeel, Jirachi, or more from Pokemon go ultra league tier list.
- You should prefer having a starter team if there is no legendary pokemon. Unlock with Candy and Stardust— wreak massive damage, building a team of three starters is more than feasible.

No doubt, such teams will struggle somewhat against steel-types, such as Escavalier. You have a lot of play against everything else. Think about the excellent strategy that when applied, meet the targets.

Your team is in your hands, be wise before hitting the battle. You might need help to pick the best Pokemon along with knowing why.

So, even with a few of the below Pokemon in your team, you should be able to fare battle while you select those as near to the 2500 CP as possible.

### 1\. Venusaur

![best Pokemon for the ultra league](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/best-Pokemon-for%20the-ultra-league.jpg)

Neglecting the fighting, which is not as prevalent in the ultra League Pokemon Go as it was in the Great League, Machamp is still strong enough, especially when you are looking for something to round off some of the powerful picks as a counter option.

### 4\. Alolan Muk

![best Ultra League Pokemon](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/best-Ultra-League-Pokemon.jpg)

One of the finest defenders in Pokemon go ultra league team, Alolan Muk has the potential to be a vital counter member. Featuring in 7 KM Eggs, the Pokemon is a poison/ dark type.

These are the Pokemons currently in the Pokemon go ultra league meta for you to use. However, it doesn’t mean you have only these options. Don’t forget about the bunch of newcomers, including Raikou, Togekiss, Meganium, Lucario, Lapras, and more. Thus you have to select your team with your mixes by keeping such information in mind.

## Where to Catch the best Pokemon for Ultra League?

Now, Pokemon Go Ultra League has a CP limitation when it comes to picking your Pokemon. CP limits players to select from a wide range of Pokemon list and also have the chance to avoid the most robust set of Pokemon in the battle. Niantic only allows the best Pokemon for the ultra league that is at or below a CP of 2700.

## The Best iSpoofer Alternative to Try On Honor X9a

_**“Is iSpoofer for Pokemon Go not working anymore? Can someone tell me how to spoof my iPhone X location now when the iSpoofer tool is shut down?”**_

If you have been using iSpoofer for a while to change your iPhone location, you can encounter a similar situation. Since iSpoofer is no longer available, users are actively looking for its alternative. In this post, I will let you know the iSpoofer use and why we can’t take its assistance to change the Pokemon Go location anymore. I will also make you familiar with the best iSpoofer alternative for iPhone and Android.

![ispoofer shutdown banner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-shutdown-banner.jpg)

## Part 1: Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

Earlier, iSpoofer used to be one of the most popular apps to change our location on Pokemon Go. Sadly, the application is no longer working and you can’t even do iSpoofer download from its website.

### Why did iSpoofer shutdown?

- The use of iSpoofer for Pokemon Go is against the terms of the game (as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party apps).
- Recently, Niantic caught many people using iSpoofer for Pokemon Go and this got their accounts banned.
- Since the iSpoofer use is no longer applicable, the company has shut down the product’s availability.
- Even if you have already done the iSpoofer download, the application will not be supported by Pokemon Go and its use will get your account terminated.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Will iSpoofer work again?

Most likely, the chances of iSpoofer working again are pretty bleak. This is because Pokemon Go users were the major target customers of the product. Since Niantic has blocklisted iSpoofer a while back, Pokemon Go players can no longer use it. Therefore, it is better to look for a reliable iSpoofer alternative instead.

![ispoofer not working](https://drfone.wondershare.com/2020/ispoofer-not-working.jpg)
