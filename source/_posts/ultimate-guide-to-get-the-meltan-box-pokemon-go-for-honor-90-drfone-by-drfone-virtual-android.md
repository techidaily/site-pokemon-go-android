A vast majority of Kirlia live in the cities, although some are still found in the forest. Kirlia evolved from Ralts and has two possible evolutions, namely Gardevoir and Gallade. If it reaches level 30, it evolves to Gardevoir. However, if it is male and given a dawn stone, it will evolve to Gallade.
