## How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On Honor 90 Pro?

Pokémon Go is a location-based AR game and is very popular in the world of gaming. Catching little cuddles and fighting to catch more-powerful Pokémon is really fun. In addition to fun, this game also increases your knowledge about the surrounding area and the diversity around your location.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-1.jpg)

For example, if you want to catch the special characters or characters of another city, you have to that place. This is the only drawback for players. However, with location spoofing apps, you can catch characters from any location without actually moving there.

Let’s find out how PGSharp and Dr.Fone virtual location app save you from getting banned while spoofing Pokémon Go.

## Part 1: Ninatic Policies against Spoofing

Getting banned for cheating Pokémon is nothing new. Niantic always modifies the policies to catch the spoofers and to maintain the originality of the game. Niantic has made a proper discipline policy with three strikes to punish the spoofers.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-spoofing-app-3.jpg)

**Firstly, punishment:** On the first fake strike, you will get a warning message, but you still can play the game. But, while plying, you will not be able to anything remotely for about seven days.

**Secondly, Punishment:** On the second fake strike, Niantic may close your account temporarily for a month. It also gives you a warning message for future misuse of the game.

**Thirdly, Punishment:** On the third strike, Niantic will ban the account for more than a month.

However, if you get caught regularly, the developer of Pokémon Go has the authority to permanently ban your account.

### Does it mean you can never spoof Pokémon Go?

No, you can spoof Pokémon Go with the best spoofing tools like PGSHarp and Dr.Fone virtual location.

This tool is safe and secure to use, plus it offers a real map interface, and it is difficult for Niantic to catch it.

There are tricks that help you save from the Pokémon Go ban.

- First, you need to use a reliable tool like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone for iOS to spoof the GPS. By doing so, Niantic can’t catch you.
