- Kadabra
- Machoke
- Graveler
- Haunter
- Boldore

You need a Special Trade whenever you wish to trade a legendary Pokemon or a shiny Pokemon in Pokemon Go. These pokemon are very rare to find and hence you won’t want to trade these rare Pokemons very often, however, you can trade a rare Pokemon only once per day. To trade a rare Pokemon would also need to be a Great or Best friend, two of the highest levels of friendship in the game Pokemon go. To increase your friendship level you need to battle and trade more and more. It'll take quite a bit of time to reach that stature of a friendship level. This could cost as much as one million, this amount will however decrease with increasing friendship levels.
