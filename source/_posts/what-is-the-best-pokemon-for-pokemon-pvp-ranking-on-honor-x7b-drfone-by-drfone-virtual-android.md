## Part 1. How Do Routes in Pokemon Go Work?

The logic behind the Pokemon Go Routes is very simple. There are only two things you need to remember about it. First, you can record a walking path anywhere and submit it for review. Your Route will immediately appear on the Pokemon Go map once it receives approval from the game developer. Of course, the quality and safety of the Route must be checked thoroughly before it becomes available to the public. Another thing about the Route is that you can use it to discover and explore new walking paths near you. All you need to do is pick your preferred Route and finish the entire trail.

- **Step 4:** From there, decide if you wish to discover nearby Routes or create your own.

**NOTE:** The Create New Route feature is only available to selected Pokemon Go players. If Pokemon Go Routes is not showing up on your end, it’s probably because you’re not yet eligible.

## Part 2. Why is Pokemon Go Routes Not Showing Up?

As previously mentioned, the root causes of the Pokemon Go Routes glitch vary from one trainer to another. It’s possible that the Pokemon Go Routes are not showing up because your Trainer Level is not high enough. Yes. This option is only available to players who reach the required level. However, the player’s respective rank is not always the culprit for this issue. There are other factors that might also result in the same problem. Check out the list below to understand it better.

![pokemon go route missing](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-4.JPG)

### There are no recorded Routes near your location

It’s possible that the Pokemon Routes are not showing up because you’re too far from them. Try to move around and see if the walking paths will finally appear on your radar. In this case, all you need to do is find the perfect spot where Routes are recorded.

### The Pokemon Go application has no adequate location access on your smartphone

![pokemon go location access](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-5.JPG)

Is Pokemon Go Route not working on your end? Well, it’s possibly because the application has limited or restricted access to GPS on your smartphone. Don’t worry. It’s nothing serious. You can easily fix this kind of misconfiguration by adjusting your privacy settings.

### Your internet connection is unstable while playing Pokemon Go

Pokemon Go Routes and most of the game’s main features require a reliable internet connection. If you’re connected to slow and unstable internet access, the Pokemon Go app will not load up properly. That’s probably the reason why Pokemon Go Routes are not completing or working at all on your end.

### You’re using an outdated Pokemon Go app version

![update pokemon go app](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/pokemon-go-route-not-working-6.JPG)

Keep in mind that the Pokemon Go Routes is an additional game feature. That’s why you first need to update your existing Pokemon Go app before you can access it. The Routes is definitely not available to old versions of Pokemon Go mobile software.

### The current software version of your smartphone is not compatible with the Pokemon Go Routes feature

Android 6.0 and iOS 14 or higher are the main system requirements of the Pokemon Go application. The Pokemon Go Routes are not working, or perhaps the whole application malfunctions because your software version is too old. Don’t worry. A simple OS update might resolve this problem once and for all.

Later, you can use a tool like Dr.Fone – Virtual Location (iOS) to spoof the GPS of your iOS device. Just connect your iPhone to the computer and enter the target location’s address or its exact coordinates. You can also use it to simulate the movement of your device in a route realistically via a GPS joystick. The best part is that the application is super-easy to use and will not need jailbreak access on your phone.
