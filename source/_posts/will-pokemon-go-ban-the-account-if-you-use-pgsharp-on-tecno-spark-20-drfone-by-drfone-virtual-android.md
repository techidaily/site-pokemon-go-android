## Will Pokémon Go Ban the Account if You Use PGSharp On Tecno Spark 20

According to the original gameplay, you need to be physically present on the battleground to catch the Pokémon. It means you can only catch those characters which are present near your location. But, you can go after special characters present away from your town or city. This is why you will look for location spoofing options.

The best location spoofer for android is PGSharp which you can install on your device to [spoof Pokémon Go](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/pokemon-go-spoofing-android.html). But yes, everything comes with a little drawback, and people are always concerned about the Pokémon Go ban for spoofing apps.

There are many fake GPS apps available that you can install, but only a few of them are safe and secure. PGSharp is best for android as it is a safe and secure app for spoofing Pokémon Go. And, if you use it, the chances of getting a ban are almost negligible.

In this article, we will discuss more PGSharp and ban.

## Part 1: Why Pokémon Go Account Get Banned

The Niantic, the developer of Pokémon Go, is particular about the safety of the game. The main priority of them with Pokémon GO is to provide a fair game experience to players worldwide. If Niantic finds something wrong with the terms of the game, then it may ban your account.

![pokemon go ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban.jpg)

The following are the reasons that may cause to ban your account:

- Engaging in harassment against any player in the game
- Using modified or unofficial software for Pokémon Go
- Installing an illegal third-party tool to play Pogo
- Fake location to catch Pokémon from different locations

If you think your account may get terminated, you should keep the terms and conditions of the game in mind. However, you can spoof location smartly with safe fake GPS like PGSharp for Android and Dr.Fone virtual location iOS.

## Part 2: Thumb Rule for spoofing with PGSharp

Once you decided to spoof Pokémon Go, you need to install a reliable and secure spoofing app. Also, you should not use your main account while spoofing. With PGSharp, you need to create a PTC account to safely spoof the game.

Do not spoof or change location frequently, as this may bring you in the radar of Niantic, and your account may get banned.

Use an app with a real map-like interface that is difficult to notice from Niantic.

### 2.1 Spoof Pokémon with PGSharp without a ban

To spoof location with PGSharp, your first need to install it from the Google Play Store. In the search bar, type “ PGSharp” and click on the install icon.

Now, when it gets installed, you can opt for a free trial or paid option. For a free trial, you will need a free beta key to use the app. For the paid version, you will need a license key that the app developer will provide you.

![pgsharp plan](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/05/pgsharp-ban-1.jpg)

To get a free beta key, go to the official site of PGSharp and look for a beta key. You may see an “out of stock” message, which means that the server has been changed. Now, you have to check the site for the beta key again. It is quite difficult to find the beta key in the first attempt.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-4.jpg)

Once you get the key, you can click on finish and can make payment in virtual currency. Also, you can fake your personal details as it is a beta key.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-5.jpg)

Now, once you got the beta key, fill it in the login details to use the PGSharp. Now, you are ready to spoof location with PGSharp on Pokémon Go.

The best part is that the app needs no root or jailbreak your device, making it a secure fake GPS tool for android.

Your account will not get banned when you use PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go with little smartness.

### 2.2 Maximum Safe Distance to Teleport with PGSharp

There is no limit to the maximum teleport distance with PGSharp. You can go to any location in the world while not present there physically. For example, you can go to California while sitting in Delhi (India). So, there is no maximum teleport limit.

But yes, you should not change the location frequently, as it will cause you trouble in the game.

## Part 3: Can I Spoof On My Main Account?

Spoofing is not legal, thus to spoof Pokemon Go, you need to use the PTC account. You should not use your main account to fake GPS with PGSharp. First, create a PTC account and then install PGSharp to spoof Pokémon Go without a ban.

![drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/09/PGSharp-ban-6.jpg)

Also, make sure to uninstall the official account to spoof the location to help you catch more Pokémon in less time.

## Part 4: Why Opt Dr.Fone Virtual Location?

Spoofing on the iPhone is a little more difficult than on Android. So, if you own an iPhone, you can use [Dr.Fone - Virtual Location app](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) to fake location. It is easy to use and easy to install. Further, this app is 100% safe to install on the iPhone as it causes no threat to your device or data.

Dr.Fone - Virtual Location also saves you from a ban and doesn’t require jailbreaking the Tecno Spark 20 device. You can teleport to any location with it in seconds. Wondersahare specially designed it for iOS users and Android users, but the Pokemon GPS cheat is not available on Android.

Once installed, connect your Tecno Spark 20 to your computer and click on get the started icon. Now you have the world map-like interface where you can search for any desired location to spoof. So, all in all, it is very easy to use for a novice too. The best part is that it causes no ban like other unsafe spoofing apps.

## Planning to Use a Pokemon Go Joystick on Tecno Spark 20?

Pokemon Go is probably one of the most popular location-based augmented reality games that encourage us to step out. Sadly, players can’t explore their surroundings or travel to play the game all the time. That’s why they often take the assistance of a Pokemon Go joystick. While Pokemon joysticks are extremely popular, they have some downfalls as well if you don’t pick the right tool. Therefore, in this post, I will list the risks and benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick hack to help you make up your mind.

![Pokemon Go Joystick Banner](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-1.jpg)

## **Part 1: Pokemon Go Joystick 101: Things to Know**

Before we get into the details, it is important to know the basics of this fake GPS Pokemon Go hack. Ideally, Pokemon Go joysticks are dedicated mobile or desktop applications that let us simulate the movement of our device. In most of the spoofing tools for Pokemon Go, the following features are offered.

- Users can directly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like in the world.
- They can also simulate the movement of their device (and the trainer) using the inbuilt joystick.
- The Pokemon Go Joystick APK can also let you set up a preferred speed for walking, jogging, or running.

![Pokemon Go Joystick](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-2.jpg)

Therefore, with the help of a Pokemon Go hack APK like this, players don’t have to leave their house to catch Pokemons. They can also participate in raids to hatch eggs from the comfort of their home.

## **Part 2: What are the Benefits of Playing Pokemon Go with a Joystick?**

There are several reasons why Pokemon Go joystick iOS/Android hacks are so popular. After all, they give us the convenience to play our favorite game without breaking a sweat. Here are some of the major reasons why Pokemon Go joystick hacks are becoming so popular:

- Stay Safe Indoors

    Since we are in the middle of a global pandemic, it is not recommended to go out to explore Pokemons. Besides that, your neighborhood might not be safe or there could be unfavorable weather conditions outside. Therefore, you can consider using a Pokemon Go joystick to catch Pokemons without compromising your safety.

- Move Beyond your Area

    If you are in a rural area, then chances are that there could be limited spawning locations for Pokemons. With a fake GPS Pokemon Go app, you can spoof your location to any major city.

- Catch More Pokemons

    One of the major benefits of using a Pokemon Go spoofer APK is that we can easily catch tons of Pokemons without exploring any area. Just enter the exact spawning location of the Pokemon and catch it!

- Level-up in the Game Easily

    From participating in raids to hatching eggs faster, there are so many other things that you can do with a Pokemon Go joystick.

- Have a Better Gaming Experience

    Overall, a Pokemon Go spoofing iOS/Android solution will provide tons of add-on features that would improve your gaming experience.

## **Part 3: What are the Risks of Using Pokemon Go Joysticks?**

While there are numerous benefits of using a Pokemon Go joystick, its constant use can also backfire in the long run.

- Account Ban by Niantic

    Ideally, you should know that the use of any third-party service (like a fake GPS Pokemon Go hack) is against the terms and conditions of the game. At first, if Niantic will detect its use, then it will simply display a warning message. Though, after several warning messages, if your account is still flagged, then it can get permanently banned.

    ![Pokemon Go Account Ban](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-3.jpg)

    To avoid the banning of your Pokemon Go account, you can consider a “cooldown duration”. This simply suggests waiting for a specific duration before changing your location in the game.

    ![Pokemon Go Cooldown Duration](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/2020/benefits-risks-pokemon-go-joystick-4.jpg)

- Software Hack on Jailbroken Devices

    To use a Pokemon Go joystick iOS hack, you might have to jailbreak your device. This can even null the warranty of your device and would make it susceptible to security threats. You might already know that a jailbroken device can easily be corrupted by the spoofer or any other app.

- The Pokemon Go Spoofing Company Might Shut Down

    Chances are that the Pokemon Go spoofing solution that you have purchased might go out of business. For instance, iSpoofer (an iOS fake GPS tool) is no longer functioning and its existing users can’t even reach out to its customer support after getting their account banned. That’s why it is highly recommended to only pick a reliable Pokemon Go joystick solution.

<iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfhgWxnARqo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

As you can see, picking a reliable Pokemon Go joystick is the most important thing to play the game remotely. Therefore, I would recommend using [Dr. Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) as the application is extremely easy to use and will meet all your Pokemon Go location spoofing needs. The best part is that you don’t even need to jailbreak your iPhone to spoof its location using Dr.Fone – Virtual Location.

- Users can instantly spoof their location on Pokemon Go to anywhere they like by entering the exact coordinates or its address.
- It also has dedicated one-stop and multi-stop modes that would let you set up a route to simulate the movement of your iPhone.
- If you want, you can even enter the preferred speed for the simulated movement or the number of times to cover it.
- The application will display a dedicated GPS joystick, letting you move realistically on the map.
- There is also an option to mark certain routes as favorites or import/export routes as GPX files.

## How to use iSpoofer on Tecno Spark 20?

iSpoofer is a location spoofer that allows you to change your location on your device. This is useful for games like Pokemon Go, where you can catch Pokemons from different regions without leaving your home. However, iSpoofer is not available for download anymore. If you are looking for an alternative to iSpoofer, you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location. Here's how you can use Dr.Fone Virtual Location to spoof your location on your Tecno Spark 20.

[![avatar](https://drfone.wondershare.com/images/alice-mj.png)](https://drfone.wondershare.com/author/alice-mj/)

iSpoofer is one of the most useful tools for iOS users, that’s designed to simulate a user's GPS location. With iSpoofer, you can change your current location to anywhere in the world and access geo-restricted content without any hassle. While the tool has several real-world applications, the majority of users use iSpoofer to fake their location to catch rare Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

Since iSpoofer is an extremely reliable app, even Android users want to know if they can use it on their smartphones or not. If you’re one of them, this guide will help. In today’s article, we are going to discuss if you can download **iSpoofer for Android** or not and what are some of the best solutions to fake GPS location on an Android device.

So, without any further ado, let’s get started.

- [Part 1: Can I download the iSpoofer on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part1)
- [Part 2: Common ways to spoof on Android](https://drfone.wondershare.com/virtual-location/ispoofer-pokemon-go-android-apk.html#part2)

## ****Part 1:  Can I download the iSpoofer on Android****

Unfortunately, iSpoofer isn’t available for Android. It’s an exclusive geo spoofing app that only works on iOS devices. In fact, all its features are tailored for the iOS ecosystem only. So, if you have an Android device, you won’t be able to download **iSpoofer for Android** at all.

However, the good news is that you don’t need iSpoofer to fake GPS location on an Android smartphone. There are dozens of Android-specific location spoofing apps that’ll help you simulate the GPS location and play Pokemon Go with a fake location. Some of these tools also come with a dedicated GPS Joystick feature, which means you’ll also be able to control your movement while sitting at one spot.

## ****Part 2:  Common ways to spoof on Android****

When it comes to choosing the right location spoofing methods for Android, you’ll have to be extra cautious. _Why?_ Because there are many fake GPS apps on Android that aren’t reliable and may damage your smartphone’s overall functionality as well.

Here are some of the most common ways to spoof location on Android devices.

1. **Use VMOS**

VMOS is an application that lets users set up a virtual machine on their Android device. This means that you’ll be able to set up two different Android systems on the same device. What makes VMOS the right tool for geo spoofing on Android is the fact that it offers a one-click root enable feature. You can easily root your virtual Android OS without damaging the firmware of the primary OS. This way you’ll be able to install professional location spoofing tools and change your GPS location without any hassle.

![vmos](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/vmos.jpg)

The only downside of using VMOS is that it’s extremely hard to set up and manage. First and foremost, you’ll need different tools to successfully set up the virtual OS on your device. Secondly, VMOS is heavy software and if your smartphone doesn’t have decent configurations, it may even slow down the overall processing.

2. **Root Your Device**

Another way to fake location on Android is to root your device. Rooting an Android device will allow you to install third-party spoofing apps that offer extensive functionality. However, when you’ll root your device, you won’t be able to claim its warranty anymore. So, in case you don’t want to void your smartphone’s warranty, ‘rooting’ may not be the right solution to fake your location in Pokemon Go.

3. **Use PGSharp**

PGSharp is one of the best alternatives to **iSpoofer for Android**. It’s a tweaked version of the original Pokemon Go app that comes with a few additional features such as spoofing and GPS Joystick. The best part about using PGSharp is that it’s compatible with all Android devices. You won’t have to root your device to install and run PGSharp.

![pgsharp](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/2020/202010/pgsharp.jpg)

You can either choose the free or the paid version of the app. Of course, the latter comes with a few additional features, but if you only want to fake location in Pokemon Go, the free version of PGSharp will get the job done as well.

**Note:** Keep in mind that PGSharp isn’t available on Google Play Store and you’ll have to download it from the official [<u>PGSharp website</u>](https://www.pgsharp.com/).

## **Extension: safest way to spoof on iOS- Dr.Fone virtual location**

So, that’s how you can fake GPS location on an Android device and collect different types of Pokemon in Pokemon Go. Even though iSPoofer isn’t available for Android, you can still use the above three methods to mock location without any effort.

It’s also worth noting that iSpoofer is permanently shut down and you can no longer install it on iOS devices as well. Even the iSpoofer website is down and if you want to fake location on your iPhone/iPad, you’ll have to look for other options. One of the best ways to change GPS location on an iOS device is to use Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS). It’s a professional geo spoofing tool for iOS that comes with a wide variety of features to mock location on Tecno Spark 20s.

It has a dedicated “Teleport Mode” that’ll allow you to change your current location to anywhere in the world. You can even set a fake location using its GPS coordinates. Like iSpoofer, [<u>Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS)</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/virtual-location-changer/) also comes with the GPS Joystick feature. This means you’ll be able to catch different types of Pokemon without moving at all.

Here are a few key features of Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).

- Change your current location with a single click
- Use GPS coordinates to find locations
- Virtually control your GPS movement using the Joystick feature
- Customize your movement speed while walking in different directions
- Compatible with all iOS versions

Follow these steps to change your GPS location on an iDevice using Dr.Fone - Virtual Location (iOS).
